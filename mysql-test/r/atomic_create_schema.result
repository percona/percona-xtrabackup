# Points to verify in this test
# scenario-1. if crash happens just after the schema directory is created, recovery should delete the directory.
# scenario-2. if crash happens happens after we insert ddl log but before the directory is created,
#             we'll have ddl log committed but no directory yet. recovery should go-through in this case.
