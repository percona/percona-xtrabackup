# Bug#58546 test rpl_packet timeout failure sporadically on PB
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# STOP REPLICA stopped IO thread first and then stopped SQL thread. It was
# possible that IO thread stopped after replicating part of a transaction
# which SQL thread was executing. SQL thread would be hung if the
# transaction could not be rolled back safely.
# It caused some sporadic failures on PB2.
#
# This test verifies that when 'STOP REPLICA' is issued by a user, IO
# thread will continue to fetch the rest events of the transaction which
# is being executed by SQL thread and is not able to be rolled back safely.
