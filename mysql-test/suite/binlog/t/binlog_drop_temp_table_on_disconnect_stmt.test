# ====== Purpose =======
#
# This test verifies that DROP for a temporary table created
# in Statement mode is logged in binlog at session disconnect.
#
# ====== Implementation ======
#
# Create temporary tables in statement mode using different engines,
# now when you connect to the session after a disconnect print the
# output of show binlog events.
# This will verify that the DROP for temporary table created in stmt
# mode is written to binary log at session disconnect.
