# Bug #17026898 PREVIOUS GTID EVENT IS NOT WRITTEN WHEN BINLOG IS ROTATED VIA
# SIGHUP

# Problem: When Bin(Relay)log is rotated via SIGHUP signal, the newly generated
# binlog does not contain previous gtid event which is very important
# for processing that bin(relay)log's gtid events later.

# Fix: If reload_acl_and_cache() (which does rotation of Bin(Relay) log)
# is called from SIGHUP handler, then allocate temporary THD for
# execution of rotate bin(relay)log.

# Steps to reproduce the issue:
# 1) Get the server pid
# 2) Send Kill -1 signal (SIGHUP) signal to server pid
# 3) Wait until rotation is done
# 4) Verify the newly generated log contains prev_gtid_event
# 5) Restart the server to see the processing of the new log is not an issue.
# 6) Verify that Replication works fine at the end of the scenario

# Execute the same steps on both Master and Slave do prove that
#   a) no problem in binary log rotation (i.e., prev_gtids_event exists)
#   b) no problem in relay log rotation (i.e., prev_gtids event exists)
#   c) no problem in restarting master
#   d) no problem in restarting slave
#   e) Replication works fine after receiving SIGHUP.
