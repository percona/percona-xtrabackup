# Note:
# The test script ask for open_files_limit=5
# The server silently increase that to 5000 before asking the OS.
# The OS may (or may not) reduce/increase open_files_limit, typically to 1024
# (Linux, see 'ulimit -n')
# So, for the ADD PARTITIONS to really reach the 'Too many open files'
# error, the test script attempts 600 partitions.
