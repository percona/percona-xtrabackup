# Bug#30192373 MYSQLD CRASH IN BINLOG SETUP DUE TO LCTN IN MAC
# This bug was specific to Mac machines where lower_case_table_names
# is 2 by default. Required metadata locks were previously
# acquired using the wrong case which eventually resulted in a
# debug assert failing down the line owing to missing MDL on
# the correct (lower case key) objects
#

# Create a database with upper case name
CREATE DATABASE DB1;
ALTER DATABASE DB1
  CHARACTER SET latin1;
USE DB1;
CREATE TABLE t1(
  id INT PRIMARY KEY
) ENGINE NDB;

# Trigger schema synchronization by restarting the MySQL server
--connection server1
let $mysqld_name=mysqld.1.1;
--source include/restart_mysqld.inc

# Check if the database and table exist
# Case of the database name differs according to platform
--replace_result db1 DB1
SHOW DATABASES;
USE DB1;
--replace_result Tables_in_db1 Tables_in_DB1
SHOW TABLES;
SHOW CREATE TABLE t1;

# Clean up
DROP DATABASE DB1;
