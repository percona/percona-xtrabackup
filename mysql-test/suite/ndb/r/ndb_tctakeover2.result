Create table with non standard partitioning
allowing colocation of operations in a single LDM
create table t1 (a int, b int, c int, primary key(a,b)) engine=ndb partition by key(a);
Insert some rows
All will be on the same partition, LDM instance, nodes
insert into t1 values (1,1,1);
insert into t1 select 1, b+1, 1 from t1;
insert into t1 select 1, b+2, 1 from t1;
insert into t1 select 1, b+4, 1 from t1;
insert into t1 select 1, b+8, 1 from t1;
insert into t1 select 1, b+16, 1 from t1;
insert into t1 select 1, b+32, 1 from t1;
insert into t1 select 1, b+64, 1 from t1;
insert into t1 select 1, b+128, 1 from t1;
insert into t1 select 1, b+256, 1 from t1;
