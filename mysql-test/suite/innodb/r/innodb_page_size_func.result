# 1. Try to restart the server with some other legal innodb page size value.
#    It must fail because we had a different value before.
# 1.1 The value assigned is a number.
# 1.2 The value assigned is a number followed by 'k'.
# 2. Try to restart the server with some innodb page size.which is either
#    bigger than the maximum or smaller than the minimum supported one.
#    It must fail because we had a different value before.
# 3. Try to restart the server with the plain wrong innodb page size value "garbage".
#    The restart attempt has to
#    - fail in case start of test page size <> the minimal legal page size.
#    - to be successful in case start of test page size = minimal legal page size.
#      In this case we omit the execution of the current sub test!
# 4. Try to restart the server with some illegal innodb page size value
#    being between minimum and maximum legal page size value.
#    The restart attempt has to fail.
# 5. Try to restart the server with wrong innodb page size <number>karamel.
#    <number>k is a legal page size.
# 6. Try to restart the server with the plain wrong innodb page size <number>caramel
#    <number>k is a legal page size.
#    The restart attempt has to
#    - fail in case start of test page size <> the minimal legal page size.
