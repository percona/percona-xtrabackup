# Bug #30258536 DEADLOCK BETWEEN LOB::ALLOC_LOB_PAGE AND ROW_UNDO_MOD_CLUST_LOW
#
# This scenario is for regression caused by fix for
# Bug #30178056 .IBD FILE GROWS INDEFINITELY FOR TABLES WITH BLOB COLUMNS
# which introduced an operation which latches first page during ROLLBACK,
# that leads to a failure of the assertion introduced in
# Bug #27777959	INNODB: ASSERTION FAILURE: UT0UT.CC DUE TO DEADLOCK AT FSP_PAGE_CREATE()
# which states that the first page of zLOB should not be latched during lob::z_rollback
