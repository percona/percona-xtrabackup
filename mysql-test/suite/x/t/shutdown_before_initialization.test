## This test-case was created for reproducing a fault that was visiable
#  rarely by toggling connection_unixsocket.test, where cleanup of
#  unixsocket was not executed

--source include/have_debug.inc
--source include/not_windows.inc
--source include/xplugin_preamble.inc


## Test Setup

# Enable "xplugin_shutdown_unixsocket" synchronization points, which
# execute code assigned to "initialization" thread and "shutdown" thread
# in concrete sequence.
#
# The Bug #31686096, described the original issue which was detected by
# x.connection_unixsocket test. This test makes the issue reproducable
# in each execution.
