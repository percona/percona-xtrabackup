# ==== Purpose ====
# The purpose of this test is to verify that, SHOW PROCESSLIST in Replica
# shows null value instead of previously executed command in the INFO section
# when slave_sql thread is waiting for updates from the Source.
#
# ==== Requirements ====
# Replica's slave_sql thread should show null value in the SHOW PROCESSLIST
# INFO section when it is waiting for updates from Source, even if the
# previoulsy executed query is a rewritten query.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
# 1. Perform an operation that can cause rewritten query on Source
# 2. Verify Replica state and info through 'SHOW PROCESSLIST'
# 3. Clean-up
#
# ==== References ====
# Bug#:30521198: IDLE & CAUGHT UP SLAVE HAS OLD QUERY SHOWN IN "INFO"
#                SECTION OF PROCESSLIST
