# BUG#47312: RBR: Disabling key on slave breaks replication:
# HA_ERR_WRONG_INDEX
#
# Description
# ===========
#   
#   This test case checks whether disabling a key on a slave breaks
#   replication or not.
#   
#   Case #1, shows that while not using ALTER TABLE... DISABLE KEYS and
#   the slave has no key defined while the master has one, replication
#   won't break.
#
#   Case #2, shows that before patch for BUG#47312, if defining key on
#   slave table, and later disable it, replication would break. This
#   has been fixed.

# BUG#53893: RBR: nullable unique key can lead to out-of-sync slave
#

#
# We insert two rows. Both with part of UNIQUE KEY set to null.
# Then we update the last row inserted. On master the correct
# row is updated. On the slave the wrong row would be updated
# because the engine would look it up by the NULL Unique KEY.
# As a consquence, the wrong row would be updated.
