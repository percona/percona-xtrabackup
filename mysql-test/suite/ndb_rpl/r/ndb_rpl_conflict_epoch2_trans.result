Therefore related row from Secondary Deleting transaction (73) is present

NDB$EPOCH_TRANS will have divergence as the Primary delete of
row 77 took out the newly inserted row 77.
NDB$EPOCH2_TRANS will have no divergence as the Secondary insert
is reflected after the Primary delete, and re-inserts the value.

Therefore related row from Secondary Deleting transaction (73) is present

Now sync with Secondary to show outcomes
NDB$EPOCH_TRANS will have divergence as the Primary delete of
row 77 took out the newly inserted row 77.
NDB$EPOCH2_TRANS will have no divergence as the Secondary insert
is reflected after the Primary delete, and re-inserts the value.
