 Known issues and limitations
==============================

There is a number of |Percona XtraBackup| related issues with compressed |InnoDB| tables. These issues result from either server-side bugs, or OS configuration and thus, cannot be fixed on the |Percona XtraBackup| side.

Known issues:

 * For |MySQL| or |Percona Server| versions 5.1 and 5.5 there are known and unfixed bugs with redo-logging of updates to compressed |InnoDB| tables. For example, internal Oracle bug #16267120 has been fixed only in |MySQL| 5.6.12, but not in 5.1 or 5.5. The bug is about compressed page images not being logged on page reorganization and thus, creating a possibility for recovery process to fail in case a different zlib version is being used when replaying a ``MLOG_ZIP_PAGE_REORGANIZE`` redo log record.

 * For |MySQL| or |Percona Server| version 5.6 it is NOT recommended to set ``innodb_log_compressed_pages=OFF`` for servers that use compressed |InnoDB| tables which are backed up with |Percona XtraBackup|. This option makes |InnoDB| recovery (and thus, backup prepare) sensible to ``zlib`` versions. In case the host where a backup prepare is performed uses a different ``zlib`` version than the one that was used by the server during runtime, backup prepare may fail due to differences in compression algorithms.

 * Backed-up table data could not be recovered if backup was taken while running ``OPTIMIZE TABLE`` (bug :bug:`1541763`) or ``ALTER TABLE ... TABLESPACE`` (bug :bug:`1532878`) on that table.

 * Compact Backups currently don't work due to bug :bug:`1192834`.

Limitations:

 * The Aria storage engine is part of |MariaDB| and has been integrated in it for many years and Aria table files backup support has been added to |innobackupex| in 2011. The issue is that the engine uses recovery log files and an :file:`aria_log_control` file that are not backuped by |innobackupex|. As stated in the `documentation <https://mariadb.com/kb/en/aria-faq/#when-is-it-safe-to-remove-old-log-files>`_, starting |MariaDB| without the :file:`maria_log_control` file will mark all the Aria tables as corrupted with this error when doing a ``CHECK`` on the table : ``Table is from another system and must be zerofilled or repaired to be usable on this system``. This means that the Aria tables from an |innobackupex| backup must be repaired before being usable (this could be quite long depending on the size of the table). Another option is ``aria_chk --zerofil table`` on all Aria tables present on the backup after the prepare phase.
