   how_xtrabackup_works

|Percona XtraBackup| is a set of following tools:

:doc:`innobackupex <innobackupex/innobackupex_script>`
    |innobackupex| is the symlink for |xtrabackup|. |innobackupex| still supports all features and syntax as 2.2 version did, but is now deprecated and will be removed in next major release.

:doc:`xtrabackup <xtrabackup_bin/xtrabackup_binary>`
    a compiled *C* binary that provides functionality to backup a whole |MySQL| database instance with |MyISAM|, |InnoDB|, and |XtraDB| tables.
    
:doc:`xbcrypt <xbcrypt/xbcrypt>`
   utility used for encrypting and decrypting backup files.

:doc:`xbstream <xbstream/xbstream>`
   utility that allows streaming and extracting files to/from the :term:`xbstream` format.

:doc:`xbcloud <xbcloud/xbcloud>`
   utility used for downloading and uploading full or part of |xbstream| archive from/to cloud.

After |Percona XtraBackup| 2.3 release the recommend way to take the backup is using the |xtrabackup| script. More information on script options can be found in :doc:`how to use xtrabackup <xtrabackup_bin/xtrabackup_binary>`.
