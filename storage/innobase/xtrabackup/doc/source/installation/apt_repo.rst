Percona ``apt`` Testing repository
----------------------------------

Percona offers pre-release builds from the testing repository. To enable it add
the just add the ``testing`` word at the end of the Percona repository
definition in your repository file (default
:file:`/etc/apt/sources.list.d/percona-release.list`). It should looks like
this (in this example ``VERSION`` is the name of your distribution):

.. code-block:: text

  deb http://repo.percona.com/apt VERSION main testing
  deb-src http://repo.percona.com/apt VERSION main testing

For example, if you are running *Debian* 8 (*jessie*) and want to install the
latest testing builds, the definitions should look like this:

.. code-block:: text

  deb http://repo.percona.com/apt jessie main testing
  deb-src http://repo.percona.com/apt jessie main testing

Apt-Pinning the packages
------------------------

In some cases you might need to "pin" the selected packages to avoid the
upgrades from the distribution repositories. You'll need to make a new file
:file:`/etc/apt/preferences.d/00percona.pref` and add the following lines in
it:

.. code-block:: text

  Package: *
  Pin: release o=Percona Development Team
  Pin-Priority: 1001

For more information about the pinning you can check the official
`debian wiki <http://wiki.debian.org/AptPreferences>`_.
