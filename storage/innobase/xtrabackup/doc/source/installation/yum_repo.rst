================================================================================
Installing |Percona XtraBackup| on *Red Hat Enterprise Linux* and *CentOS*
================================================================================

Ready-to-use packages are available from the |Percona XtraBackup| software
repositories and the `download page
<https://www.percona.com/downloads/XtraBackup/>`_. The |Percona| :program:`yum`
repository supports popular *RPM*-based operating systems, including the *Amazon
Linux AMI*.

The easiest way to install the *Percona Yum* repository is to install an *RPM*
that configures :program:`yum` and installs the `Percona GPG key
<https://www.percona.com/downloads/RPM-GPG-KEY-percona>`_.

Supported Releases:

 * *CentOS* 6 and *RHEL* 6 (Current Stable)
 * *CentOS* 7 and *RHEL* 7
 * *Amazon Linux AMI* (works the same as *CentOS* 6)
 * *Amazon Linux 2*

.. note::

   *Current Stable*: We support only the current stable RHEL6/CentOS6 release,
   because there is no official (i.e. RedHat provided) method to support or
   download the latest OpenSSL on RHEL/CentOS versions prior to 6.5.  Similarly,
   and also as a result thereof, there is no official Percona way to support the
   latest Percona XtraBackup builds on RHEL/CentOS versions prior to
   6.5. Additionally, many users will need to upgrade to OpenSSL 1.0.1g or later
   (due to the `Heartbleed vulnerability
   <http://www.percona.com/resources/ceo-customer-advisory-heartbleed>`_), and
   this OpenSSL version is not available for download from any official
   RHEL/CentOS repository for versions 6.4 and prior. For any officially
   unsupported system, src.rpm packages may be used to rebuild |Percona
   XtraBackup| for any environment. Please contact our `support service
   <http://www.percona.com/products/mysql-support>`_ if you require further
   information on this.


The *CentOS* repositories should work well with *Red Hat Enterprise Linux* too,
provided that :program:`yum` is installed on the server.

Supported architectures:

* x86_64 (also known as ``amd64``)

What's in each RPM package?

Installing |Percona XtraBackup| from Percona ``yum`` repository
===============================================================

1. Install the Percona yum repository by running the following command as the
   ``root`` user or with :program:`sudo`: :bash:`yum install https://repo.percona.com/yum/percona-release-latest.noarch.rpm`

#.
   .. include:: ../.res/contents/instruction.repository.enabling.txt
	     
#. Install |Percona XtraBackup| by running:  :bash:`yum install percona-xtrabackup-80`

.. warning::

   Make sure that you have the ``libev`` package installed before
   installing |Percona XtraBackup| on CentOS 6. For this operating system, the
   ``libev`` package is available from the `EPEL
   <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL>`_ repositories.

#. To be able to make compressed backups, install the ``qpress`` package:

   $ yum install qpress

Installing |Percona XtraBackup| using downloaded rpm packages
================================================================================

Download the packages of the desired series for your architecture from the
`download page <https://www.percona.com/downloads/XtraBackup/>`_. The following
example downloads |Percona XtraBackup| 8.0.4 release package for *CentOS*
7:

.. code-block:: bash


   $ wget https://www.percona.com/downloads/XtraBackup/Percona-XtraBackup-8.0.4/binary/redhat/7/x86_64/percona-xtrabackup-80-8.0.4-1.el7.x86_64.rpm

Now you can install |Percona XtraBackup| by running ``yum localinstall``:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ yum localinstall percona-xtrabackup-80-8.0.4-1.el7.x86_64.rpm

.. note::

   When installing packages manually like this, you'll need to make sure to
   resolve all the dependencies and install missing packages yourself.
