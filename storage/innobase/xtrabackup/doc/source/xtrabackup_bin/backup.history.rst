.. _pxb.xtrabackup.history.storing:

================================================================================
Backup history stored on the server
================================================================================
 
|Percona XtraBackup| supports storing the backup's history on the server. Storing backup history on the server was implemented to provide users with additional information about
backups that are being taken. Backup history information will be stored in the
:ref:`PERCONA_SCHEMA.XTRABACKUP_HISTORY <xtrabackup_history>` table.

To use this feature the following options are available:

* :option:`--history` =<name> : This option enables the history
  feature and allows the user to specify a backup series name that will be
  placed within the history record.
* :option:`--incremental-history-name` =<name> : This option allows an
  incremental backup to be made based on a specific history series by
  name. **Percona XtraBackup** searches the history table for the most recent
  (highest ``to_lsn``) backup in the series and take the ``to_lsn`` value to use
  as its starting lsn. This is mutually exclusive with
  :option:`--incremental-history-uuid`, :option:`--incremental-basedir` and
  :option:`--incremental-lsn` options. If no valid LSN can be found
  (no series by that name) *Percona XtraBackup* will return with an error.
* :option:`--incremental-history-uuid` =<uuid> : Allows an incremental backup to
  be made based on a specific history record identified by UUID. *Percona XtraBackup*
  will search the history table looking for the record matching UUID and take
  the ``to_lsn`` value to use as it's starting LSN. This options is mutually
  exclusive with :option:`--incremental-basedir`, :option:`--incremental-lsn`
  and :option:`--incremental-history-name` options. If no valid LSN can be found
  (no record by that UUID or missing ``to_lsn``), *Percona XtraBackup* will return
  with an error.

.. note::

   Backup that's currently being performed does **NOT** exist in the
   xtrabackup_history table within the resulting backup set. The record is added to that table after the backup has been taken.

If you want access to backup history outside of your backup set in the case of
some catastrophic event, you will need to either perform a ``mysqldump``,
partial backup or ``SELECT`` * on the history table after *Percona XtraBackup*
completes and store the results with you backup set.

For the necessary privileges, see :ref:`pxb.privilege`.
