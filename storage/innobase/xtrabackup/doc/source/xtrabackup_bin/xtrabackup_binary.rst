 The xtrabackup Binary
================================================================================

The |xtrabackup| binary is a compiled C program that is linked with the |InnoDB|
libraries and the standard |MySQL| client libraries.

|xtrabackup| enables point-in-time backups of |InnoDB| / |XtraDB| tables
together with the schema definitions, |MyISAM| tables, and other portions of the
server.

The |InnoDB| libraries provide the functionality to apply a log to data
files. The |MySQL| client libraries are used to parse command-line options and
configuration file.

The tool runs in either :option:`--backup` or :option:`--prepare` mode,
corresponding to the two main functions it performs. There are several
variations on these functions to accomplish different tasks, and there are two
less commonly used modes, :option:`--stats` and :option:`--print-param`.
