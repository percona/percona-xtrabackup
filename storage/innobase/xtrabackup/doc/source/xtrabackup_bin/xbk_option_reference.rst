============================================
 The :program:`xtrabackup` Option Reference
============================================

.. .. program:: xtrabackup

This page documents all of the command-line options for the
:program:`xtrabackup` binary.

Modes of operation
================================================================================

You invoke |program| in one of the following modes:

- :option:`--backup` mode to make a backup in a target directory
- :option:`--prepare` mode to restore data from a backup (created in :option:`--backup` mode)
- :option:`--copy-back` to copy data from a backup to the location
  that contained the original data; to move data instead of copying use
  the alternate :option:`--move-back` mode.
- :option:`--stats` mode to scan the specified data files and print out index statistics.

When you intend to run |program| in any of these modes, use the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ xtrabackup [--defaults-file=#] --backup|--prepare|--copy-back|--stats [OPTIONS]

For example, the :option:`--prepare` mode is applied as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ xtrabackup --prepare --target-dir=/data/backup/mysql/

For all modes, the default options are read from the **xtrabackup** and
**mysqld** configuration groups from the following files in the given order:

1. :file:`/etc/my.cnf`
#. :file:`/etc/mysql/my.cnf`
#. :file:`/usr/etc/my.cnf`
#. :file:`~/.my.cnf`. 

As the first parameter to |program| (in place of the :option:`--defaults-file`,
you may supply one of the following:

- :option:`--print-defaults` to have |program| print the argument list and exit.
- :option:`--no-defaults` to forbid reading options from any file but the login file.   
- :option:`--defaults-file`  to read the default options from the given file.
- :option:`--defaults-extra-file` to read the specified additional file after
  the global files have been read.
- :option:`--defaults-group-suffix` to read the configuration groups with the
  given suffix. The effective group name is constructed by concatenating the default
  configuration groups (**xtrabackup** and **mysqld**) with the given suffix.
- :option:`--login-path` to read the given path from the login file.

.. rubric:: InnoDB Options

There is a large group of InnoDB options that are normally read from the
:file:`my.cnf` configuration file, so that |program| boots up its embedded
InnoDB in the same configuration as your current server. You normally do not
need to specify them explicitly. These options have the same behavior in InnoDB
and XtraDB. See :option:`--innodb-miscellaneous` for more information.

Options
=======

.. option:: --apply-log-only

   This option causes only the redo stage to be performed when preparing a
   backup. It is very important for incremental backups.

.. option:: --backup

   Make a backup and place it in :option:`--target-dir`. See
   :ref:`Creating a backup <creating_a_backup>`.

.. option:: --backup-lock-timeout

   The timeout in seconds for attempts to acquire metadata locks.

.. option:: --backup-lock-retry-count

   The number of attempts to acquire metadata locks.

.. option:: --backup-locks

   This option controls if backup locks should be used instead of ``FLUSH TABLES
   WITH READ LOCK`` on the backup stage. The option has no effect when backup
   locks are not supported by the server. This option is enabled by default,
   disable with :option:`--no-backup-locks`.

.. option:: --check-privileges

   This option checks if |Percona XtraBackup| has all required privileges.
   If a missing privilege is required for the current operation,
   it will terminate and print out an error message.
   If a missing privilege is not required for the current operation,
   but may be necessary for some other XtraBackup operation,
   the process is not aborted and a warning is printed.

   .. code-block:: bash

      xtrabackup: Error: missing required privilege LOCK TABLES on *.*
      xtrabackup: Warning: missing required privilege REPLICATION CLIENT on *.*

.. option:: --close-files

   Do not keep files opened. When |xtrabackup| opens tablespace it normally
   doesn't close its file handle in order to handle the DDL operations
   correctly. However, if the number of tablespaces is really huge and can not
   fit into any limit, there is an option to close file handles once they are
   no longer accessed. |Percona XtraBackup| can produce inconsistent backups
   with this option enabled. Use at your own risk.

.. option:: --compress

   This option tells |xtrabackup| to compress all output data, including the
   transaction log file and meta data files, using either the ``quicklz`` or
   ``lz4`` compression algorithm. ``quicklz`` is chosen by default.

   When using ``--compress=quicklz`` or ``--compress``, the resulting files have
   the qpress archive format, i.e. every ``*.qp`` file produced by |xtrabackup| is
   essentially a one-file qpress archive and can be extracted and uncompressed
   by the `qpress <http://www.quicklz.com/>`_ file archiver.

   ``--compress=lz4`` produces ``*.lz4`` files. You can extract the contents of
   these files by using a program such as ``lz4``.

   .. seealso::

      QuickLZ
         http://www.quicklz.com
      LZ4
         https://lz4.github.io/lz4/

.. option:: --compress-chunk-size=#

   Size of working buffer(s) for compression threads in bytes. The default
   value is 64K.

.. option:: --compress-threads=#

   This option specifies the number of worker threads used by |xtrabackup| for
   parallel data compression. This option defaults to ``1``. Parallel
   compression (:option:`--compress-threads`) can be used together
   with parallel file copying (:option:`--parallel`). For example,
   ``--parallel=4 --compress --compress-threads=2`` will create 4 I/O threads
   that will read the data and pipe it to 2 compression threads.

.. option:: --copy-back

   Copy all the files in a previously made backup from the backup directory to
   their original locations. This option will not copy over existing files
   unless :option:`--force-non-empty-directories` option is
   specified.

.. option:: --core-file

   Write core on fatal signals.

.. option:: --databases=#

   This option specifies a list of databases and tables that should be backed
   up. The option accepts the list of the form ``"databasename1[.table_name1]
   databasename2[.table_name2] . . ."``.

.. option::  --databases-exclude=name

   Excluding databases based on name, Operates the same way
   as :option:`--databases`, but matched names are excluded from
   backup. Note that this option has a higher priority than
   :option:`--databases`.

.. option:: --databases-file=#

   This option specifies the path to the file containing the list of databases
   and tables that should be backed up. The file can contain the list elements
   of the form ``databasename1[.table_name1]``, one element per line.

.. option:: --datadir=DIRECTORY

   The source directory for the backup. This should be the same as the datadir
   for your |MySQL| server, so it should be read from :file:`my.cnf` if that
   exists; otherwise you must specify it on the command line.

   When combined with the :option:`--copy-back` or
   :option:`--move-back` option, :option:`--datadir`
   refers to the destination directory.

   Once connected to the server, in order to perform a backup you will need
   ``READ`` and ``EXECUTE`` permissions at a filesystem level in the
   server's :term:`datadir`.


.. option:: --debug-sleep-before-unlock=#

   This is a debug-only option used by the |xtrabackup| test suite.

.. option:: --debug-sync=name

   The debug sync point. This option is only used by the |xtrabackup| test suite.

.. option:: --decompress

   Decompresses all files with the :file:`.qp` extension in a backup previously
   made with the :option:`--compress` option. The
   :option:`--parallel` option will allow multiple files to be
   decrypted simultaneously. In order to decompress, the qpress utility MUST be
   installed and accessible within the path. |Percona XtraBackup| does not
   automatically remove the compressed files. In order to clean up the backup
   directory users should use :option:`--remove-original` option.

   The :option:`--decompress` option may be used with |xbstream| to
   decompress individual qpress files.

   If you used the ``lz4`` compression algorithm to compress the files
   (``--compress=lz4``), change the :option:`--decompress` parameter
   accordingly: ``--decompress=lz4``.

.. option:: --decompress-threads=#

   Force |xbstream| to use the specified number of threads for
   decompressing.

.. option:: --decrypt=ENCRYPTION-ALGORITHM

   Decrypts all files with the :file:`.xbcrypt` extension in a backup
   previously made with :option:`--encrypt` option. The
   :option:`--parallel` option will allow multiple files to be
   decrypted simultaneously. |Percona XtraBackup| doesn't
   automatically remove the encrypted files. In order to clean up the backup
   directory users should use :option:`--remove-original` option.

.. option:: --defaults-extra-file=[MY.CNF]

   Read this file after the global files are read. Must be given as the first
   option on the command-line.

.. option:: --defaults-file=[MY.CNF]

   Only read default options from the given file. Must be given as the first
   option on the command-line. Must be a real file; it cannot be a symbolic
   link.

.. option:: --defaults-group=GROUP-NAME

   This option is to set the group which should be read from the configuration
   file. This is used by |xtrabackup| if you use the
   :option:`--defaults-group` option. It is needed for
   ``mysqld_multi`` deployments.

.. option:: --defaults-group-suffix=#

   Also reads groups with concat(group, suffix).

.. option::  --dump-innodb-buffer-pool

   This option controls whether or not a new dump of buffer pool
   content should be done.

   With ``--dump-innodb-buffer-pool``, |xtrabackup|
   makes a request to the server to start the buffer pool dump (it
   takes some time to complete and is done in background) at the
   beginning of a backup provided the status variable
   ``innodb_buffer_pool_dump_status`` reports that the dump has been
   completed.

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ xtrabackup --backup --dump-innodb-buffer-pool --target-dir=/home/user/backup

   By default, this option is set to `OFF`.

   If ``innodb_buffer_pool_dump_status`` reports that there is running
   dump of buffer pool, |xtrabackup| waits for the dump to complete
   using the value of :option:`--dump-innodb-buffer-pool-timeout`

   The file :file:`ib_buffer_pool` stores tablespace ID and page ID
   data used to warm up the buffer pool sooner.

   .. seealso::

      |MySQL| Documentation: Saving and Restoring the Buffer Pool State
         https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-preload-buffer-pool.html

.. option:: --dump-innodb-buffer-pool-timeout

   This option contains the number of seconds that |xtrabackup| should
   monitor the value of ``innodb_buffer_pool_dump_status`` to
   determine if buffer pool dump has completed.
      
   This option is used in combination with
   :option:`--dump-innodb-buffer-pool`. By default, it is set to `10`
   seconds.

.. option:: --dump-innodb-buffer-pool-pct

   This option contains the percentage of the most recently used buffer pool
   pages to dump.

   This option is effective if :option:`--dump-innodb-buffer-pool` option is set
   to `ON`. If this option contains a value, |xtrabackup| sets the |MySQL|
   system variable ``innodb_buffer_pool_dump_pct``. As soon as the buffer pool
   dump completes or it is stopped (see
   :option:`--dump-innodb-buffer-pool-timeout`), the value of the |MySQL| system
   variable is restored.

.. option:: --encrypt=ENCRYPTION_ALGORITHM

   This option instructs xtrabackup to encrypt backup copies of InnoDB data
   files using the algorithm specified in the ENCRYPTION_ALGORITHM. Currently
   supported algorithms are: ``AES128``, ``AES192`` and ``AES256``

.. option:: --encrypt-key=ENCRYPTION_KEY

   A proper length encryption key to use. It is not recommended to use this
   option where there is uncontrolled access to the machine as the command line
   and thus the key can be viewed as part of the process info.

.. option:: --encrypt-key-file=ENCRYPTION_KEY_FILE

   The name of a file where the raw key of the appropriate length can be read
   from. The file must be a simple binary (or text) file that contains exactly
   the key to be used.

   It is passed directly to the xtrabackup child process. See the
   :program:`xtrabackup` :doc:`documentation
   <../xtrabackup_bin/xtrabackup_binary>` for more details.

.. option:: --encrypt-threads=#

   This option specifies the number of worker threads that will be used for
   parallel encryption/decryption.
   See the :program:`xtrabackup` :doc:`documentation
   <../xtrabackup_bin/xtrabackup_binary>` for more details.

.. option:: --encrypt-chunk-size=#

   This option specifies the size of the internal working buffer for each
   encryption thread, measured in bytes. It is passed directly to the
   xtrabackup child process. See the :program:`xtrabackup` :doc:`documentation
   <../xtrabackup_bin/xtrabackup_binary>` for more details.

.. option:: --export

   Create files necessary for exporting tables. See :doc:`Restoring Individual
   Tables <restoring_individual_tables>`.

.. option:: --extra-lsndir=DIRECTORY

   (for --backup): save an extra copy of the :file:`xtrabackup_checkpoints`
   and :file:`xtrabackup_info` files in this directory.

.. option:: --force-non-empty-directories

   When specified, it makes :option:`--copy-back` and
   :option:`--move-back` option transfer files to non-empty
   directories. No existing files will be overwritten. If files that need to
   be copied/moved from the backup directory already exist in the destination
   directory, it will still fail with an error.

.. option:: --ftwrl-wait-timeout=SECONDS

   This option specifies time in seconds that xtrabackup should wait for
   queries that would block ``FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK`` before running it.
   If there are still such queries when the timeout expires, xtrabackup
   terminates with an error. Default is ``0``, in which case it does not wait
   for queries to complete and starts ``FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK``
   immediately. Where supported |xtrabackup| will
   automatically use `Backup Locks
   <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/8.0/management/backup_locks.html#backup-locks>`_
   as a lightweight alternative to ``FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK`` to copy
   non-InnoDB data to avoid blocking DML queries that modify InnoDB tables.

.. option:: --ftwrl-wait-threshold=SECONDS

   This option specifies the query run time threshold which is used by
   xtrabackup to detect long-running queries with a non-zero value of
   :option:`--ftwrl-wait-timeout`. ``FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK``
   is not started until such long-running queries exist. This option has no
   effect if :option:`--ftwrl-wait-timeout` is ``0``. Default value
   is ``60`` seconds. Where supported xtrabackup will
   automatically use `Backup Locks
   <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/8.0/management/backup_locks.html#backup-locks>`_
   as a lightweight alternative to ``FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK`` to copy
   non-InnoDB data to avoid blocking DML queries that modify InnoDB tables.

.. option:: --ftwrl-wait-query-type=all|update

   This option specifies which types of queries are allowed to complete before
   xtrabackup will issue the global lock. Default is ``all``.

.. option:: --galera-info

   This option creates the :file:`xtrabackup_galera_info` file which contains
   the local node state at the time of the backup. Option should be used when
   performing the backup of |Percona XtraDB Cluster|. It has no effect when
   backup locks are used to create the backup.

.. option:: --generate-new-master-key 

   Generate a new master key when doing a copy-back.

.. option:: --generate-transition-key

   |xtrabackup| needs to access the same keyring file or vault server
   during `prepare` and `copy-back` but it should not depend on whether the
   server keys have been purged.

   :option:`--generate-transition-key` creates and adds to the keyring
   a transition key for |xtrabackup| to use if the master key used for
   encryption is not found because it has been rotated and purged.

.. option:: --get-server-public-key

   Get the server public key

   .. seealso::

      |MySQL| Documentation: The --get-server-public-key Option

         https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/connection-options.html#option_general_get-server-public-key

.. option:: --help
 
   When run with this option or without any options |xtrabackup| displays
   information about how to run the program on the command line along with all
   supported options and variables with default values where appropriate.

.. option:: --history=NAME

   This option enables the tracking of backup history in the
   ``PERCONA_SCHEMA.xtrabackup_history`` table. An optional history series name
   may be specified that will be placed with the history record for the current
   backup being taken.

.. option:: --host=HOST

   This option accepts a string argument that specifies the host to use when
   connecting to the database server with TCP/IP. It is passed to the mysql
   child process without alteration. See :command:`mysql --help` for details.

.. option:: --incremental

   This option tells |xtrabackup| to create an incremental backup. It is passed
   to the |xtrabackup| child process. When this option is specified, either
   :option:`--incremental-lsn` or :option:`--incremental-basedir` can also be
   given. If neither option is given, option :option:`--incremental-basedir` is
   passed to :program:`xtrabackup` by default, set to the first timestamped
   backup directory in the backup base directory.

   .. seealso::

      More information about incremental backups
         See section :ref:`xb_incremental`

.. option:: --incremental-basedir=DIRECTORY

   When creating an incremental backup, this is the directory containing the
   full backup that is the base dataset for the incremental backups.

.. option:: --incremental-dir=DIRECTORY

   When preparing an incremental backup, this is the directory where the
   incremental backup is combined with the full backup to make a new full
   backup.

.. option:: --incremental-force-scan

   When creating an incremental backup, force a full scan of the data pages in
   the instance being backuped even if the complete changed page bitmap data is
   available.

.. option:: --incremental-history-name=name 

   This option specifies the name of the backup series stored in the
   ``PERCONA_SCHEMA.xtrabackup_history`` history record to base an incremental
   backup on. |xtrabackup| will search the history table looking for the most
   recent (highest ``innodb_to_lsn``), successful backup in the series and take
   the to_lsn value to use as the starting ``lsn`` for the incremental
   backup. This will be mutually exclusive with
   :option:`--incremental-history-uuid`, :option:`--incremental-basedir` and
   :option:`--incremental-lsn`. If no valid lsn can be found (no series by that
   name, no successful backups by that name) |xtrabackup| will return with an
   error. It is used with the :option:`--incremental` option.

.. option:: --incremental-history-uuid=name 

   This option specifies the *UUID* of the specific history record stored in the
   ``PERCONA_SCHEMA.xtrabackup_history`` to base an incremental backup on.
   :option:`--incremental-history-name`, :option:`--incremental-basedir` and
   :option:`--incremental-lsn`. If no valid lsn can be found (no success record
   with that *UUID*) |xtrabackup| will return with an error. It is used with
   the --incremental option.

.. option:: --incremental-lsn=LSN

   When creating an incremental backup, you can specify the log sequence number
   (:term:`LSN`) instead of specifying
   :option:`--incremental-basedir`. For databases created in 5.1 and
   later, specify the :term:`LSN` as a single 64-bit integer. **ATTENTION**: If
   a wrong LSN value is specified (a user  error which |Percona XtraBackup| is
   unable to detect), the backup will be unusable. Be careful!

.. option::   --innodb[=name]

   This option is ignored for MySQL option compatibility.

.. option:: --innodb-miscellaneous

   There is a large group of InnoDB options that are normally read from the
   :file:`my.cnf` configuration file, so that |xtrabackup| boots up its
   embedded InnoDB in the same configuration as your current server. You
   normally do not need to specify these explicitly. These options have the
   same behavior in InnoDB and XtraDB:

   .. hlist::
      :columns: 2
      
      - --innodb-adaptive-hash-index
      - --innodb-additional-mem-pool-size
      - --innodb-autoextend-increment
      - --innodb-buffer-pool-size

      - --innodb-open-files
      - --innodb-page-size
      - --innodb-read-io-threads
      - --innodb-redo-log-encrypt
      - --innodb-undo-directory
      - --innodb-undo-log-encrypt
      - --innodb-undo-tablespaces` 
      - --innodb-use-native-aio
      - --innodb-write-io-threads

.. option:: --keyring-file-data=FILENAME

   The path to the keyring file. Combine this option with
   :option:`--xtrabackup-plugin-dir`.

.. option:: --kill-long-queries-timeout=SECONDS

   This option specifies the number of seconds |xtrabackup| waits between
   starting ``FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK`` and killing those queries that block
   it. Default is 0 seconds, which means |xtrabackup| will not attempt to kill
   any queries. In order to use this option xtrabackup user should have the
   ``PROCESS`` and ``SUPER`` privileges. Where supported, |xtrabackup|
   automatically uses `Backup Locks
   <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/8.0/management/backup_locks.html#backup-locks>`_
   as a lightweight alternative to ``FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK`` to copy
   non-InnoDB data to avoid blocking DML queries that modify InnoDB tables.

.. option:: --kill-long-query-type=all|select

   This option specifies which types of queries should be killed to unblock the
   global lock. Default is "all".

.. option:: --lock-ddl

   Issue ``LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP`` if it is supported by server (otherwise use
   ``LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP``) at the beginning of the backup to block all DDL
   operations.

.. option:: --lock-ddl-per-table

   Lock DDL for each table before xtrabackup starts to copy
   it and until the backup is completed.

.. option:: --lock-ddl-timeout

   If ``LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP`` or ``LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP`` does not return
   within given timeout, abort the backup.

.. option:: --log

   This option is ignored for |mysql|

.. option:: --log-bin

   The base name for binary log files. Use an absolute path as the value of this
   parameter to specify a custom location for binary log files.

   .. seealso::

      |mysql| Documentation:

         - `--bin-log option
	   <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-options-binary-log.html#option_mysqld_log-bin>`_

.. option:: --log-bin-index=name 

   File that holds the names for binary log files.

.. option:: --log-copy-interval=#

   This option specifies the time interval between checks done by the log
   copying thread in milliseconds (default is 1 second).

.. option:: --login-path

   Read the given path from the login file.

.. option:: --move-back

   Move all the files in a previously made backup from the backup directory to
   their original locations. As this option removes backup files, it must be
   used with caution.

.. option:: --no-backup-locks

   Explicity disables the :option:`--backup-locks` option which is enabled by
   default.

.. option:: --no-defaults

   The default options are only read from the login file.

.. option:: --no-lock

   Use this option to disable table lock with ``FLUSH TABLES WITH READ
   LOCK``. Use it only if ALL your tables are InnoDB and you **DO NOT CARE**
   about the binary log position of the backup. This option shouldn't be used if
   there are any ``DDL`` statements being executed or if any updates are
   happening on non-InnoDB tables (this includes the system MyISAM tables in the
   *mysql* database), otherwise it could lead to an inconsistent backup. Where
   supported |xtrabackup| will automatically use `Backup Locks
   <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/8.0/management/backup_locks.html#backup-locks>`_
   as a lightweight alternative to ``FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK`` to copy
   non-InnoDB data to avoid blocking DML queries that modify InnoDB tables.  If
   you are considering to use this because your backups are failing to acquire
   the lock, this could be because of incoming replication events are preventing
   the lock from succeeding. Please try using :option:`--safe-slave-backup` to
   momentarily stop the replication slave thread, this may help the backup to
   succeed and you do not need to use this option.

   :file:`xtrabackup_binlog_info` is not created when --no-lock option is used
   (because ``SHOW MASTER STATUS`` may be inconsistent), but under certain
   conditions :file:`xtrabackup_binlog_pos_innodb` can be used instead to get
   consistent binlog coordinates as described in :ref:`working_with_binlogs`.

.. include:: ../_res/text/option.no-version-check.txt

.. option:: --open-files-limit=# 

   The maximum number of file descriptors to reserve with setrlimit().

.. option:: --parallel=#

   This option specifies the number of threads to use to copy multiple data
   files concurrently when creating a backup. The default value is 1 (i.e., no
   concurrent transfer). In |Percona XtraBackup| 2.3.10 and newer, this option
   can be used with the :option:`--copy-back` option to copy the user
   data files in parallel (redo logs and system tablespaces are copied in the
   main thread).

.. option:: --password=PASSWORD

   This option specifies the password to use when connecting to the database.
   It accepts a string argument. See :command:`mysql --help` for details.

.. option::   --plugin-load

   List of plugins to load.

.. option:: --port=PORT

   This option accepts a string argument that specifies the port to use when
   connecting to the database server with TCP/IP. It is passed to the
   :command:`mysql` child process without alteration. See :command:`mysql
   --help` for details.

.. option:: --prepare

   Makes :program:`xtrabackup` perform a recovery on a backup created with
   :option:`--backup`, so that it is ready to use. See
   :ref:`preparing a backup <preparing_a_backup>`.

.. option:: --print-defaults

   Print the program argument list and exit. Must be given as the first option
   on the command-line.

.. option:: --print-param

   Makes :program:`xtrabackup` print out parameters that can be used for
   copying the data files back to their original locations to restore them. 

.. option:: --read-buffer-size

   Set the datafile read buffer size, given value is scaled up to page size. Default
   is 10Mb.


.. option:: --rebuild-indexes

   Rebuilds indexes in a compact backup. This option only has effect when the
   :option:`--prepare` and :option:`--rebuild-threads` options are provided.

.. option:: --rebuild-threads=#

   Uses the given number of threads to rebuild indexes in a compact backup. This
   option only has effect with the :option:`--prepare` and
   :option:`--rebuild-indexes` options.

.. option:: --remove-original

   Implemented in |Percona XtraBackup| 2.4.6, this option when specified will
   remove :file:`.qp`, :file:`.xbcrypt` and :file:`.qp.xbcrypt` files after
   decryption and decompression.

.. option:: --rocksdb-datadir

   RocksDB data directory

.. option:: --rocksdb-wal-dir

   RocksDB WAL directory.

.. option:: --rocksdb-checkpoint-max-age

   The checkpoint cannot be older than this number of seconds when the backup
   completes.

.. option:: --rocksdb-checkpoint-max-count

   Complete the backup even if the checkpoint age requirement has not been met after
   this number of checkpoints.

.. option:: --rollback-prepared-trx

   Force rollback prepared InnoDB transactions.

.. option:: --rsync

   Uses the :program:`rsync` utility to optimize local file transfers. When this
   option is specified, |xtrabackup| uses :program:`rsync` to copy
   all non-InnoDB files instead of spawning a separate :program:`cp` for each
   file, which can be much faster for servers with a large number of databases
   or tables.  This option cannot be used together with :option:`--stream`.

.. option:: --safe-slave-backup

   When specified, xtrabackup will stop the replication SQL thread just before
   running ``FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK`` and wait to start backup until
   ``Slave_open_temp_tables`` in ``SHOW STATUS`` is zero. If there are no open
   temporary tables, the backup will take place, otherwise the SQL thread will
   be started and stopped until there are no open temporary tables. The backup
   will fail if ``Slave_open_temp_tables`` does not become zero after
   :option:`--safe-slave-backup-timeout` seconds. The slave SQL
   thread will be restarted when the backup finishes. This option is
   implemented in order to deal with `replicating temporary tables
   <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-features-temptables.html>`_
   and isn't neccessary with Row-Based-Replication.

.. option:: --safe-slave-backup-timeout=SECONDS

   How many seconds :option:`--safe-slave-backup` should wait for
   ``Slave_open_temp_tables`` to become zero. Defaults to 300 seconds.

.. option:: --secure-auth

   Refuse client connecting to server if it uses old (pre-4.1.1) protocol.
   (Enabled by default; use --skip-secure-auth to disable.)

.. option:: --server-id=#

   The server instance being backed up.

.. option:: --server-public-key-path

   The file path to the server public RSA key in the PEM format.

   .. seealso::

      |MySQL| Documentation: The --server-public-key-path Option
         https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/connection-options.html#option_general_server-public-key-path

.. option:: --skip-tables-compatibility-check

   See :option:`--tables-compatibility-check`.

.. option:: --slave-info

   This option is useful when backing up a replication slave server. It prints
   the binary log position of the master server. It also writes the binary log
   coordinates to the :file:`xtrabackup_slave_info` file as a ``CHANGE MASTER``
   command. A new slave for this master can be set up by starting a slave server
   on this backup and issuing a ``CHANGE MASTER`` command with the binary log
   position saved in the :file:`xtrabackup_slave_info` file.

.. option:: --socket

   This option accepts a string argument that specifies the socket to use when
   connecting to the local database server with a UNIX domain socket. It is
   passed to the mysql child process without alteration. See :command:`mysql
   --help` for details.

.. option:: --ssl

   Enable secure connection. More information can be found in `--ssl
   <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/encrypted-connection-options.html>`_
   MySQL server documentation.

   MySQL server documentation.

.. option:: --ssl-cipher

   List of permitted ciphers to use for connection encryption. More information
   can be found in `--ssl-cipher
   <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/encrypted-connection-options.html#option_general_ssl-cipher>`_
   MySQL server documentation.

   MySQL server documentation.

.. option:: --ssl-crlpath

   Path of directory that contains certificate revocation list files. More
   information can be found in `--ssl-crlpath
   <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/encrypted-connection-options.html#option_general_ssl-crlpath>`_
   MySQL server documentation.

.. option:: --ssl-fips-mode

   SSL FIPS mode (applies only for OpenSSL); permitted values are: *OFF*, *ON*,
   *STRICT*.

.. option:: --ssl-key

   Path of file that contains X509 key in PEM format. More information can be
   found in `--ssl-key
   <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/encrypted-connection-options.html#option_general_ssl-key>`_
   MySQL server documentation.

.. option:: --ssl-mode

   Security state of connection to server. More information can be found in
   `--ssl-mode
   <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/encrypted-connection-options.html#option_general_ssl-mode>`_
   MySQL server documentation.

.. option:: --ssl-verify-server-cert

   Verify server certificate Common Name value against host name used when
   connecting to server. More information can be found in
   `--ssl-verify-server-cert
   <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/encrypted-connection-options.html#option_general_ssl-verify-server-cert>`_
   MySQL server documentation.

.. option:: --stats

   Causes :program:`xtrabackup` to scan the specified data files and print out
   index statistics.

.. option:: --stream=FORMAT

   Stream all backup files to the standard output in the specified format.
   Currently, this option only supports the `xbstream` format.

.. option:: --strict

   If this option is specified, |xtrabackup| fails with an error when invalid
   parameters are passed.

.. option:: --tables=name

   A regular expression against which the full tablename, in
   ``databasename.tablename`` format, is matched. If the name matches, the
   table is backed up. See :doc:`partial backups <partial_backups>`.

.. option:: --tables-compatibility-check

   Enables the engine compatibility warning. The default value is
   ON. To disable the engine compatibility warning use
   :option:`--skip-tables-compatibility-check`.


.. option:: --tables-exclude=name

   Filtering by regexp for table names. Operates the same
   way as :option:`--tables`, but matched names are excluded from
   backup. Note that this option has a higher priority than
   :option:`--tables`.

.. option:: --tables-file=name

   A file containing one table name per line, in databasename.tablename format.
   The backup will be limited to the specified tables. 

.. option:: --target-dir=DIRECTORY

   This option specifies the destination directory for the backup. If the
   directory does not exist, :program:`xtrabackup` creates it. If the directory
   does exist and is empty, :program:`xtrabackup` will succeed.
   :program:`xtrabackup` will not overwrite existing files, however; it will
   fail with operating system error 17, ``file exists``.

   If this option is a relative path, it is interpreted as being relative to
   the current working directory from which :program:`xtrabackup` is executed.

   In order to perform a backup, you need ``READ``, ``WRITE``, and ``EXECUTE``
   permissions at a filesystem level for the directory that you supply as the
   value of :option:`--target-dir`.


.. option:: --innodb-temp-tablespaces-dir=DIRECTORY

   Directory where temp tablespace files live, this path can be absolute.

.. option:: --throttle=#

   This option limits the number of chunks copied per second. The chunk size is
   *10 MB*. To limit the bandwidth to *10 MB/s*, set the option to *1*:
   `--throttle=1`.

   .. seealso::

      More information about how to throttle a backup
         :ref:`throttling_backups`

.. option:: --tls-ciphersuites

   TLS v1.3 cipher to use.

.. option:: --tls-version

   TLS version to use, permitted values are: *TLSv1*, *TLSv1.1*,
   *TLSv1.2*, *TLSv1.3*.

.. option:: --tmpdir=name

   Specify the directory that will be used to store temporary files during the
   backup

.. option:: --transition-key=name

   This option is used to enable processing the backup without accessing the
   keyring vault server. In this case, :program:`xtrabackup` derives the AES
   encryption key from the specified passphrase and uses it to encrypt
   tablespace keys of tablespaces being backed up.

   If :option:`--transition-key` does not have any
   value, :program:`xtrabackup` will ask for it. The same passphrase should be
   specified for the :option:`--prepare` command.

.. option:: --use-memory

   This option affects how much memory is allocated for preparing a backup with
   :option:`--prepare`, or analyzing statistics with
   :option:`--stats`. Its purpose is similar
   to :term:`innodb_buffer_pool_size`. It does not do the same thing as the
   similarly named option in Oracle's InnoDB Hot Backup tool.
   The default value is 100MB, and if you have enough available memory, 1GB to
   2GB is a good recommended value. Multiples are supported providing the unit
   (e.g. 1MB, 1M, 1GB, 1G).

.. option:: --user=USERNAME

   This option specifies the MySQL username used when connecting to the server,
   if that's not the current user. The option accepts a string argument. See
   mysql --help for details.

.. option:: -v

   See :option:`--version`

.. option:: --version

   This option prints |xtrabackup| version and exits.

.. option:: --xtrabackup-plugin-dir=DIRNAME

   The absolute path to the directory that contains the ``keyring`` plugin.
