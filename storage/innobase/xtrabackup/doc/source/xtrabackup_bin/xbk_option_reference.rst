============================================
 The `xtrabackup` Option Reference
============================================

.. program:: xtrabackup

This page documents all of the command-line options for the
`xtrabackup` binary.

Options
=======

.. option:: --apply-log-only

   This option causes only the redo stage to be performed when preparing a
   backup. It is very important for incremental backups.

.. option:: --backup

   Make a backup and place it in `xtrabackup --target-dir`. See
   :ref:`Creating a backup <creating_a_backup>`.
   
.. option:: --backup-lock-retry-count=#

   The number of attempts to acquire metadata locks.
   
.. option:: --backup-lock-timeout=#

   The timeout in seconds for attempts to acquire metadata locks.

.. option:: --binlog-info

   This option controls how *Percona XtraBackup* should retrieve the server's
   binary log coordinates corresponding to the backup. Possible values are
   ``OFF``, ``ON``, ``LOCKLESS`` and ``AUTO``. See the *Percona XtraBackup*
   :ref:`lockless_bin-log`  manual page for more information.

.. option:: --check-privileges

   This option checks if *Percona XtraBackup* has all the required privileges.
   If a missing privilege is required for the current operation,
   it will terminate and print out an error message.
   If a missing privilege is not required for the current operation
   but may be necessary for some other XtraBackup operation,
   the process is not aborted, and a warning is printed.

   .. code-block:: bash

     xtrabackup: Error: missing required privilege LOCK TABLES on *.*
     xtrabackup: Warning: missing required privilege REPLICATION CLIENT on *.*

.. option:: --close-files

   Do not keep files open. When *xtrabackup* opens a tablespace, it normally
   does not close its file handle to manage the DDL operations
   correctly. However, if the number of tablespaces is huge and can not
   fit into any limit, there is an option to close file handles once they are
   no longer accessed. *Percona XtraBackup* can produce inconsistent backups
   with this option enabled. Use the option at your own risk.

.. option:: --compact

   Create a compact backup by skipping secondary index pages.
   
.. option:: --compress

   This option tells *xtrabackup* to compress all output data, including the
   transaction log file and metadata files, using the specified compression
   algorithm. The only currently supported algorithm is ``quicklz``. The
   resulting files have the qpress archive format.
   
   Every ``*.qp`` file
   produced by xtrabackup is essentially a one-file qpress archive and can be
   extracted and uncompressed by the `qpress <http://www.quicklz.com/>`_  file
   archiver.

.. option:: --compress-chunk-size=#

   Size of working buffer(s) for compression threads in bytes. The default
   value is 64K.

.. option:: --compress-threads=#

   This option specifies the number of worker threads used by *xtrabackup* for
   parallel data compression. This option defaults to ``1``. Parallel
   compression (` xtrabackup --compress-threads`) can be used together
   with parallel file copying (`xtrabackup --parallel`). For example,
   ``--parallel=4 --compress --compress-threads=2`` will create 4 I/O threads
   that will read the data and pipe it to 2 compression threads.

.. option:: --copy-back

   Copy all the files in a previously made backup from the backup directory to
   their original locations. This option will not copy over existing files
   unless `xtrabackup --force-non-empty-directories` option is
   specified.

.. option:: --core-file

   Write core on fatal signals.
   
.. option:: --databases=#

   This option specifies the list of databases and tables that should be backed
   up. The option accepts the list of the form ``"databasename1[.table_name1]
   databasename2[.table_name2] . . ."``.

.. option::  --databases-exclude=name

   Excluding databases based on name. This option operates the same way
   as `xtrabackup --databases`, but matched names are excluded from the
   backup. Note that this option has a higher priority than
   `xtrabackup --databases`.

.. option:: --databases-file=#

   This option specifies the path to the file containing the list of databases
   and tables that should be backed up. The file can contain the list elements
   of the form ``databasename1[.table_name1]``, one element per line.

.. option:: --datadir=DIRECTORY

   The source directory for the backup. This directory should be the same as the datadir
   for your *MySQL* server, and it should be read from `my.cnf` if that
   exists; otherwise, you must specify it on the command line.

   When combined with the `xtrabackup --copy-back` or
   `xtrabackup --move-back` option, `xtrabackup --datadir`
   refers to the destination directory.

   Once connected to the server, to perform a backup, you will need
   ``READ`` and ``EXECUTE`` permissions at a filesystem level in the
   server's `datadir`.

.. option:: --debug-sleep-before-unlock=#

   A debug-only option that is used by the Xtrabackup test suite.
   
.. option:: --decompress

   This option decompresses all files with the `.qp` extension in a backup previously
   made with the `xtrabackup --compress` option. The
   `xtrabackup --parallel` option will allow multiple files to be
   decrypted simultaneously. To decompress, the qpress utility MUST be
   installed and accessible within the path. *Percona XtraBackup* doesn't
   automatically remove the compressed files. To clean up the backup
   directory, users should use the `xtrabackup --remove-original` option.

.. option:: --decrypt=ENCRYPTION-ALGORITHM

   Decrypts all files with the `.xbcrypt` extension in a backup
   previously made with `xtrabackup --encrypt` option. The
   `xtrabackup --parallel` option will allow multiple files to be
   decrypted simultaneously. *Percona XtraBackup* doesn't
   automatically remove the encrypted files. To clean up the backup
   directory, users should use `xtrabackup --remove-original` option.

.. option:: --defaults-extra-file=[MY.CNF]

   Read this file after the global files are read. This file must be the first
   option on the command-line.

.. option:: --defaults-file=[MY.CNF]

   Only read default options from the given file. This file must be the first
   option on the command-line and be a real file and cannot be a symbolic
   link.

.. option:: --defaults-group=GROUP-NAME

   This option sets up the group which should be read from the configuration
   file. The option is used by the `--default-group` and is required for

   ``mysqld_multi`` deployments.
   
.. option:: --defaults-group-suffix=#

   Read the usual options groups and also groups with concat(group, suffix).

.. option::  --dump-innodb-buffer-pool

   This option controls whether or not a new dump of buffer pool
   content should be done.

   With ``--dump-innodb-buffer-pool``, *xtrabackup*
   makes a request to the server to start the buffer pool dump (it
   takes some time to complete and is done in background) at the
   beginning of a backup provided the status variable
   ``innodb_buffer_pool_dump_status`` reports that the dump has been
   completed.

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ xtrabackup --backup --dump-innodb-buffer-pool --target-dir=/home/user/backup

   By default, this option is set to `OFF`.

   If ``innodb_buffer_pool_dump_status`` reports that there is running
   dump of the buffer pool, *xtrabackup* waits for the dump to complete
   using the value of `--dump-innodb-buffer-pool-timeout`

   The file `ib_buffer_pool` stores tablespace ID and page ID
   data used to warm up the buffer pool sooner.

   .. seealso::

      *MySQL* Documentation: Saving and Restoring the Buffer Pool State
         https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-preload-buffer-pool.html

.. option:: --dump-innodb-buffer-pool-timeout

   This option contains the number of seconds that *xtrabackup* should
   monitor the value of ``innodb_buffer_pool_dump_status`` to
   determine if buffer pool dump has completed.
      
   This option is used in combination with
   `--dump-innodb-buffer-pool`. By default, it is set to `10`
   seconds.

.. option:: --dump-innodb-buffer-pool-pct

   This option contains the percentage of the most recently used buffer pool
   pages to dump.

   This option is effective if `--dump-innodb-buffer-pool` option is set
   to `ON`. If this option contains a value, *xtrabackup* sets the *MySQL*
   system variable ``innodb_buffer_pool_dump_pct``. As soon as the buffer pool
   dump completes or it is stopped (see
   `--dump-innodb-buffer-pool-timeout`), the value of the *MySQL* system
   variable is restored.

.. option:: --encrypt=ENCRYPTION_ALGORITHM

   This option instructs xtrabackup to encrypt backup copies of InnoDB data
   files using the algorithm specified in the ENCRYPTION_ALGORITHM. It is
   passed directly to the xtrabackup child process. See the
   `xtrabackup`
   :doc:`documentation <../xtrabackup_bin/xtrabackup_binary>` for more details.

.. option:: --encrypt-key=ENCRYPTION_KEY

   This option instructs xtrabackup to use the given ``ENCRYPTION_KEY`` when
   using the `xtrabackup --encrypt` option. It is passed directly to
   the xtrabackup child process. See the `xtrabackup`
   :doc:`documentation <../xtrabackup_bin/xtrabackup_binary>` for more details.

.. option:: --encrypt-key-file=ENCRYPTION_KEY_FILE

   This option instructs xtrabackup to use the encryption key stored in the
   given ``ENCRYPTION_KEY_FILE`` when using the `xtrabackup --encrypt`
   option. It is passed directly to the xtrabackup child process. See the
   `xtrabackup` :doc:`documentation
   <../xtrabackup_bin/xtrabackup_binary>` for more details.

.. option:: --encrypt-threads=#

   This option specifies the number of worker threads that will be used for
   parallel encryption/decryption.
   See the `xtrabackup` :doc:`documentation
   <../xtrabackup_bin/xtrabackup_binary>` for more details.

.. option:: --encrypt-chunk-size=#

   This option specifies the size of the internal working buffer for each
   encryption thread, and is measured in bytes. It is passed directly to the
   xtrabackup child process. See the `xtrabackup` :doc:`documentation
   <../xtrabackup_bin/xtrabackup_binary>` for more details.

   .. note::

      To adjust the xbcloud/xbstream chunk size when you use encryption, you must adjust both the --encrypt-chunk-size and --read-buffer-size variables.

.. option:: --export

   Create files necessary for exporting tables. See :doc:`Restoring Individual
   Tables <restoring_individual_tables>`.

.. option:: --extra-lsndir=DIRECTORY

   (for --backup): save an extra copy of the `xtrabackup_checkpoints`
   and `xtrabackup_info` files in this directory.

.. option:: --force-non-empty-directories

   When specified, it makes :option`xtrabackup --copy-back` and
   `xtrabackup --move-back` option transfer files to non-empty
   directories. No existing files will be overwritten. If files that need to
   be copied/moved from the backup directory already exist in the destination
   directory, it will still fail with an error.

.. option:: --ftwrl-wait-timeout=SECONDS

   This option specifies time in seconds that xtrabackup should wait for
   queries that would block ``FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK`` before running it.
   If there are still such queries when the timeout expires, xtrabackup
   terminates with an error. The default is ``0``, in which case it does not wait
   for queries to complete and starts ``FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK``
   immediately. Where supported (Percona Server 5.6+) xtrabackup will
   automatically use `Backup Locks
   <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/5.6/management/backup_locks.html#backup-locks>`_
   as a lightweight alternative to ``FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK`` to copy
   non-InnoDB data to avoid blocking DML queries that modify InnoDB tables.

.. option:: --ftwrl-wait-threshold=SECONDS

   This option specifies the query run time threshold which is used by
   xtrabackup to detect long-running queries with a non-zero value of
   `xtrabackup --ftwrl-wait-timeout`. ``FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK``
   is not started until such long-running queries exist. This option has no
   effect if `xtrabackup --ftwrl-wait-timeout` is ``0``. The default value
   is ``60`` seconds. Where supported (Percona Server 5.6+) xtrabackup will
   automatically use `Backup Locks
   <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/5.6/management/backup_locks.html#backup-locks>`_
   as a lightweight alternative to ``FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK`` to copy
   non-InnoDB data to avoid blocking DML queries that modify InnoDB tables.

.. option:: --ftwrl-wait-query-type=all|update

   This option specifies which types of queries are allowed to complete before
   xtrabackup will issue the global lock. The default is ``all``.

.. option:: --galera-info

   This options creates the `xtrabackup_galera_info` file which contains
   the local node state at the time of the backup. Option should be used when
   performing the backup of Percona XtraDB Cluster. It has no effect when
   backup locks are used to create the backup.

.. option:: --generate-new-master-key

   Generates a new master key when doing a copy-back operation.
   
.. option:: --history=name

   This option enables the tracking of the backup history in the
   ``PERCONA_SCHEMA.xtrabackup_history`` table. An optional history series name
   may be specified that will be placed with the history record for the backup
   being taken.

.. option:: --incremental

   This option tells xtrabackup to create an incremental backup. It is passed to
   the xtrabackup child process. When this option is specified, either
   `xtrabackup --incremental-lsn` or `xtrabackup
   --incremental-basedir` can also be given. If neither option is given, option
   `xtrabackup --incremental-basedir` is passed to xtrabackup by
   default, set to the first timestamped backup directory in the backup base
   directory.

   .. seealso:: :ref:`More information about incremental backups <xb_incremental>`


.. option:: --incremental-basedir=DIRECTORY

   This directory contains the full backup, which is the base dataset used for the incremental backups.

.. option:: --incremental-dir=DIRECTORY

   When preparing an incremental backup, this is the directory where the
   incremental backup is combined with the full backup to make a new full
   backup.

.. option:: --incremental-force-scan

   When creating an incremental backup, force a full scan of the data pages in
   the instance to be used in the backup even if the complete changed page bitmap data is
   available.

.. option:: --incremental-history-name=name

   This option specifies the name of the backup series stored in the
   :ref:`PERCONA_SCHEMA.xtrabackup_history <xtrabackup_history>` history record
   to base an incremental backup on. *xtrabackup* searches the history
   table for the most recent (highest innodb_to_lsn), successful backup
   in the series and take the to_lsn value to use as the starting lsn for the
   incremental backup. This will be mutually exclusive with `xtrabackup
   --incremental-history-uuid`, `xtrabackup --incremental-basedir` and
   `xtrabackup --incremental-lsn`. If no valid `LSN` can be found
   (no series by that name, no successful backups by that name) *xtrabackup*
   returns an error. It is used with the `xtrabackup --incremental`
   option.

.. option:: --innodb-checksum-algorithm=name

   The algorithm InnoDB uses to calculate a page checksum. The available
   algorithms are CRC32, INNODB, NONE, STRICT_CRC32, STRICT_INNODB,
   and STRICT_NONE
   
.. option:: --incremental-history-uuid=UUID

   This option specifies the `UUID` of the specific history record stored
   in the :ref:`PERCONA_SCHEMA.xtrabackup_history <xtrabackup_history>` to base
   an incremental backup on. `xtrabackup --incremental-history-name`,
   `xtrabackup --incremental-basedir` and `xtrabackup
   --incremental-lsn`. If no valid `LSN` is found (no success record with
   that `UUID`) *xtrabackup* returns an error. This option is used with
   the `xtrabackup --incremental` option.

.. option:: --incremental-lsn=LSN

   When creating an incremental backup, you can specify the log sequence number
   (`LSN`) instead of specifying
   `xtrabackup --incremental-basedir`. For databases created in 5.1 and
   later, specify the `LSN` as a single 64-bit integer. **ATTENTION**: If
   a wrong LSN value is specified (a user  error that *Percona XtraBackup* cannot detect), the backup will be unusable. Be careful!

.. option:: --innodb-log-arch-dir=DIRECTORY

   This option is used to specify the directory containing the archived logs.
   It can only be used with the `xtrabackup --prepare` option.

.. option:: --innodb-miscellaneous

   A large group of InnoDB options are normally read from the
   `my.cnf` configuration file, so that *xtrabackup* boots up its
   embedded InnoDB in the same configuration as your current server. You
   normally do not need to specify these explicitly. These options have the
   same behavior that they have in InnoDB or XtraDB. They are as follows: ::

    --innodb-adaptive-hash-index
    --innodb-additional-mem-pool-size
    --innodb-autoextend-increment
    --innodb-buffer-pool-size
    --innodb-checksums
    --innodb-data-file-path
    --innodb-data-home-dir
    --innodb-doublewrite-file
    --innodb-doublewrite
    --innodb-extra-undoslots
    --innodb-fast-checksum
    --innodb-file-io-threads
    --innodb-file-per-table
    --innodb-flush-log-at-trx-commit
    --innodb-flush-method
    --innodb-force-recovery
    --innodb-io-capacity
    --innodb-lock-wait-timeout
    --innodb-log-buffer-size
    --innodb-log-files-in-group
    --innodb-log-file-size
    --innodb-log-group-home-dir
    --innodb-max-dirty-pages-pct
    --innodb-open-files
    --innodb-page-size
    --innodb-read-io-threads
    --innodb-write-io-threads

.. option:: --innodb-undo-directory=name

   The directory location for the undo tablespace. The path is absolute.

.. option:: --innodb-undo-tablespace=#

   The number of undo tablespaces to use.
   
.. option:: --keyring-file-data=FILENAME

   The path to the keyring file. Combine this option with
   `xtrabackup --xtrabackup-plugin-dir`.

.. option:: --kill-long-queries-timeout=#

   This options specifies the number of seconds xtrabackup waits between
   starting FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK and killing those queries that block
   it. The default is ``0`` (zero) seconds, which means the xtrabackup does not
   attempt to kill any queries.
   
.. option:: --kill-long-query-type=select|all

   This option specifies which types of queries should be killed to unblock the global lock. The default value is ``select``. 
   
.. option:: --lock-ddl

   Issue ``LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP`` if it is supported by server
   at the beginning of the backup to block all DDL operations.

.. option:: --lock-ddl-per-table

   Lock DDL for each table before xtrabackup starts to copy
   it and until the backup is completed.

.. option:: --lock-ddl-timeout

   If ``LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP`` does not return within given
   timeout, abort the backup.

.. option:: --log-bin[=name]

   The base name for the log sequence.
   
.. option:: --log-copy-interval=#

   This option specifies time interval between log copying
   thread checks in milliseconds (default is 1 second).

.. option:: --login-path=#

   Read this path from the login file.
   
.. option:: --move-back

   Move all the files in a previously made backup from the backup directory to
   their original locations. As this option removes backup files, it must be
   used with caution.

.. option:: --no-backup-locks

   This options controls if backup locks are used instead of ``FLUSH TABLES
   WITH READ LOCK`` during the backup stage. The backup locks are must be supported on the server for the option to have an affect.
   
   This option is enabled by default. Disable the option
   with `--no-backup-locks`.
   
.. option:: --no-defaults

   Do not read the default options from any option file. Must be given as the first
   option on the command-line.

.. option:: --no-lock

   This option automatically uses Backup Locks, and disables table locks, as a
   lightweight alternative to ``FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK`` to copy
   non-InnoDB data to avoid blocking DML queries that modify InnoDB tables.
   
   Only use this option if *all* tables are InnoDB and you *do not care* about
   the binary log position of the backup.
   
   Do not use this option if any DDL statements will be executed or if any
   non-InnoDB tables are being updated (this includes the MyISAM tables in the
   mysql database). Using this option in these conditions could cause an
   inconsistent backup.
   
   If your backups fail to acquire a lock and you are planning to use this
   option, the failure may be caused by incoming replication events that
   prevent the lock from succeeding. Try the ``--safe-slave-backup``
   to momentarily stop the replication slave thread.
   
   The `xtrabackup-binlog-info` is not created when the `--no-lock`
   is used because ``SHOW MASTER STATUS`` may be inconsistent. In certain
   conditions, ``xtrabackup_binlog_pos_innodb`` can be used instead to get
   consistent binlog coordinates as described in :ref:`working_with_binlogs`.
   
.. option:: --no-version-check

   This option disables the version check. If you do not pass this option, the
   automatic version check is enabled implicitly when xtrabackup runs
   in the ``--backup`` mode. To disable the version check, explicitly pass
   the ``--no-version-check`` option when invoking xtrabackup.

   When the automatic version check is enabled,xtrabackup performs a
   version check against the server on the backup stage after creating a server
   connection. xtrabackup sends the following information to the server:

   - MySQL flavour and version
   - Operating system name
   - Percona Toolkit version
   - Perl version

   Each piece of information has a unique identifier which is an MD5 hash value
   that Percona Toolkit uses to obtain statistics about how it is used. This value is
   a random UUID; no client information is either collected or stored.

   
.. option:: --open-files-limit=#

   The maximum number of file descriptors to reserve with setrlimit().
   
.. option:: --parallel=#

   This option specifies the number of threads to use to copy multiple data
   files concurrently when creating a backup. The default value is 1 (i.e., no
   concurrent transfer). In *Percona XtraBackup* 2.3.10 and newer, this option
   can be used with `xtrabackup --copy-back` option to copy the user
   data files in parallel (redo logs and system tablespaces are copied in the
   main thread).

.. option:: --password=PASSWORD

   This option specifies the password to use when connecting to the database.
   It accepts a string argument. See ``mysql --help`` for details.

.. option:: --prepare

   Makes `xtrabackup` perform recovery on a backup created with
   `xtrabackup --backup`, so that it is ready to use. See
   :ref:`preparing a backup <preparing_a_backup>`.

.. option:: --print-defaults

   Print the program argument list and exit. Must be given as the first option
   on the command-line.

.. option:: --print-param

   Makes `xtrabackup` print out parameters that to copy the data files back to their original locations to restore them. See
   :ref:`scripting-xtrabackup`.

.. option:: --read-buffer-size[=#]

   Set read buffer size. The given value is scaled up to page size. The
   default is 10MB.
  
   Use this variable to increase the xbcloud/xbstream chunk size from the default value of 10MB. 

.. note::

   When you use encryption, to adjust the xbcloud/xbstream chunk size, adjust both the ``--encrypt-chunk-size`` and ``--read-buffer-size`` variables.

   .. code-block:: mysql

      $ xtrabackup ... --read-buffer-size=1G | xbcloud put ...
   
.. option:: --rebuild-indexes

   Rebuild secondary indexes in InnoDB tables after applying the log. Only use
   with `--prepare`.
   
.. option:: --rebuild-threads=#

   This option defines the number of threads to rebuild indexes in a compact
   backup. Only use with `--prepare` and `--rebuild-indexes`.
   
.. option:: --redo-log-version=#

   The redo log version of the backup. Use only with `--prepare`.
   
.. option:: --reencrypt-for-server-id=<new_server_id>

   Use this option to start the server instance with different server_id from
   the one the encrypted backup was taken from, like a replication replica or a
   Galera node. When this option is used, xtrabackup will, as a prepare step,
   generate a new master key with ID based on the new server_id, store it into
   keyring file, and re-encrypt the tablespace keys inside of tablespace
   headers. The option should be passed for `--prepare` (final step).

.. option:: --remove-original

   Implemented in *Percona XtraBackup* 2.4.6, this option when specified will
   remove `.qp`, `.xbcrypt` and `.qp.xbcrypt` files after
   decryption and decompression.

.. option:: --rsync

   Use the ``rsync`` utility to optimize local file transfers.
   
   When this option is specified, xtrabackup uses ``rsync`` to copy all
   non-InnoDB files instead of spawning a separate copy command for each file.
   This option is faster for servers with a large number of databases or tables.
   
   This option cannot be used with `--stream`.
   
.. option:: --safe-slave-backup

   When specified, xtrabackup will stop the replica SQL thread just before
   running ``FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK`` and wait to start backup until
   ``Slave_open_temp_tables`` in ``SHOW STATUS`` is zero. If there are no open
   temporary tables, the backup will occur; otherwise the SQL thread will
   be started and stopped until there are no open temporary tables. The backup
   will fail if ``Slave_open_temp_tables`` does not become zero after
   `xtrabackup --safe-slave-backup-timeout` seconds. The replica SQL
   thread will be restarted when the backup finishes. This option is
   implemented to deal with `replicating temporary tables
   <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-features-temptables.html>`_
   and isn't neccessary with Row-Based-Replication.

.. option:: --safe-slave-backup-timeout=SECONDS

   How many seconds `xtrabackup --safe-slave-backup` should wait for
   ``Slave_open_temp_tables`` to become zero. The default is 300 seconds.

.. option:: --secure-auth

   Refuse client connecting to the server if it uses old (pre-4.1.1) protocol.
   (Enabled by default; use --skip-secure-auth to disable.)

.. option:: --server-id=#

   The server instance being backed up.
   
.. option:: --server-public-key-path=name

   File path the server's public RSA key in PEM format.
   
.. option:: --skip-tables-compatibility-check

   This option disables the engine compatibility warning.
   
   .. seealso:: `--tables-compatibility-check`

.. option:: --slave-info

   This option is useful when backing up a replication replica server. It prints
   the binary log position of the source server. It also writes the binary log
   coordinates to the `xtrabackup_slave_info` file as a ``CHANGE MASTER``
   command. A new replica for this source can be set up by starting a replica server
   on this backup and issuing a ``CHANGE MASTER`` command with the binary log

   connecting to server. More information can be found in
   `--ssl-verify-server-cert
   <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/secure-connection-options.html#option_general_ssl-verify-server-cert>`_
   MySQL server documentation.

.. option:: --stats

   Causes `xtrabackup` to scan the specified data files and print out
   index statistics.

.. option:: --stream=name

   Stream all backup files to the standard output in the specified format.
   Currently supported formats are ``xbstream`` and ``tar``.

.. option:: --tables=name

   A regular expression against which the full tablename, in
   ``databasename.tablename`` format, is matched. If the name matches, the
   table is backed up. See :doc:`partial backups <partial_backups>`.
   
.. option:: --tables-compatibility-check

   This option enables the engine compatibility warning.
   
   The default value is ``ON``. Use `--skip-tables-compatibility-check`
   to disable.

.. option:: --tables-exclude=name

   Filtering by regexp for table names. Operates the same
   way as `xtrabackup --tables`, but matched names are excluded from
   backup. Note that this option has a higher priority than
   `xtrabackup --tables`.

.. option:: --tables-file=name

   A file containing one table name per line, in databasename.tablename format.
   The backup will be limited to the specified tables. See
   :ref:`scripting-xtrabackup`.

.. option:: --target-dir=DIRECTORY

   This option specifies the destination directory for the backup. If the
   directory does not exist, `xtrabackup` creates it. If the directory
   does exist and is empty, `xtrabackup` will succeed.
   `xtrabackup` will not overwrite existing files; however it will
   fail with operating system error 17, ``file exists``.

   If this option is a relative path, it is interpreted as being relative to
   the current working directory from which `xtrabackup` is executed.

   In order to perform a backup, you need ``READ``, ``WRITE``, and ``EXECUTE``
   permissions at a filesystem level for the directory that you supply as the
   value of `--target-dir`.

.. option:: --throttle=#

   This option limits the number of chunks copied per second. The chunk size is
   *10 MB*. 
   
   To limit the bandwidth to *10 MB/s*, set the option to *1*:
   `--throttle=1`.

         :ref:`throttling_backups`
         
.. option:: --tls-version=name

   The TLS version to use. The allowed values are the following:
   
   * TLSv1
   * TLSv1.1
   * TLSv1.2

.. option:: --tmpdir=name

   This option is currently not used for anything except printing out the
   correct tmpdir parameter when `xtrabackup --print-param` is used.

.. option:: --to-archived-lsn=LSN

   This option is used to specify the LSN to which the logs should be applied
   when backups are being prepared. It can only be used with the
   `xtrabackup --prepare` option.

.. option:: --transition-key

   This option is used to enable processing the backup without accessing the
   keyring vault server. In this case, `xtrabackup` derives the AES
   encryption key from the specified passphrase and uses it to encrypt
   tablespace keys of tablespaces being backed up.

   If `--transition-key <xtrabackup --transition-key>` does not have any
   value, `xtrabackup` will ask for it. The same passphrase should be
   specified for the `xtrabackup --prepare` command.

.. option:: --use-memory=#

   This option affects how much memory is allocated for preparing a backup with
   `xtrabackup --prepare`, or analyzing statistics with
   `xtrabackup --stats`. Its purpose is similar
   to `innodb_buffer_pool_size`. It does not do the same thing as the
   similarly named option in Oracle's InnoDB Hot Backup tool.
   The default value is 100MB, and if you have enough available memory, 1GB to
   2GB is a good recommended value. Multiples are supported providing the unit
   (e.g. 1MB, 1M, 1GB, 1G).

.. option:: --user=USERNAME

   This option specifies the MySQL username used when connecting to the server,
   if that's not the current user. The option accepts a string argument. See
   mysql --help for details.

.. option:: --version

   This option prints *xtrabackup* version and exits.

.. option:: --xtrabackup-plugin-dir=DIRNAME

   The absolute path to the directory that contains the ``keyring`` plugin.
