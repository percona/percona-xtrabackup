Incremental Backups
================================================================================

*Percona XtraBackup* supports incremental backups. It copies only the data that has
changed since the last full backup. You can perform many incremental backups
between each full backup, so you can set up a backup process such as a full
backup once a week and an incremental backup every day, or full backups every
day and incremental backups every hour.

Incremental backups work because each InnoDB page (usually 16kb in size)
contains a log sequence number, or :term:`LSN`. The :term:`LSN` is the system
version number for the entire database. Each page's :term:`LSN` shows how
recently it was changed. An incremental backup copies each page whose
:term:`LSN` is newer than the previous incremental or full backup's
:term:`LSN`. There are two algorithms in use to find the set of such pages to be
copied. The first one, available with all the server types and versions, is to
check the page :term:`LSN` directly by reading all the data pages. The second
one, available with |Percona Server|, is to enable the `changed page tracking
<http://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/5.5/management/changed_page_tracking.html>`_
feature on the server, which will note the pages as they are being changed. This
information will be then written out in a compact separate so-called bitmap
file. The *Percona XtraBackup* binary will use that file to read only the data pages it
needs for the incremental backup, potentially saving many read requests. The
latter algorithm is enabled by default if the *Percona XtraBackup* binary finds the
bitmap file. It is possible to specify :option:`--incremental-force-scan` to
read all the pages even if the bitmap data is available.

Incremental backups do not actually compare the data files to the previous
backup's data files. In fact, you can use :option:`--incremental-lsn` to perform
an incremental backup without even having the previous backup, if you know its
:term:`LSN`. Incremental backups simply read the pages and compare their
:term:`LSN` to the last backup's :term:`LSN`. You still need a full backup to
recover the incremental changes, however; without a full backup to act as a
base, the incremental backups are useless.

Creating an Incremental Backup
================================================================================

To make an incremental backup, begin with a full backup as usual. The
*Percona XtraBackup* binary writes a file called :file:`xtrabackup_checkpoints` into the
backup's target directory. This file contains a line showing the ``to_lsn``,
which is the database's :term:`LSN` at the end of the backup. :ref:`Create the
full backup <creating_a_backup>` with a command such as the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ xtrabackup --backup --target-dir=/data/backups/base --datadir=/var/lib/mysql/

If you look at the :file:`xtrabackup_checkpoints` file, you should see contents
similar to the following: ::

  backup_type = full-backuped
  from_lsn = 0
  to_lsn = 1291135

Now that you have a full backup, you can make an incremental backup based on
it. Use a command such as the following: 

.. code-block:: bash

   $ xtrabackup --backup --target-dir=/data/backups/inc1 \
   --incremental-basedir=/data/backups/base --datadir=/var/lib/mysql/

The :file:`/data/backups/inc1/` directory should now contain delta files, such
as :file:`ibdata1.delta` and :file:`test/table1.ibd.delta`. These represent the
changes since the ``LSN 1291135``. If you examine the
:file:`xtrabackup_checkpoints` file in this directory, you should see something
similar to the following: ::

  backup_type = incremental
  from_lsn = 1291135
  to_lsn = 1291340

The meaning should be self-evident. It's now possible to use this directory as
the base for yet another incremental backup:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ xtrabackup --backup --target-dir=/data/backups/inc2 \
   --incremental-basedir=/data/backups/inc1 --datadir=/var/lib/mysql/

Preparing the Incremental Backups
================================================================================

The :option:`--prepare` step for incremental backups is not the same as for
normal backups. In normal backups, two types of operations are performed to make
the database consistent: committed transactions are replayed from the log file
against the data files, and uncommitted transactions are rolled back. You must
skip the rollback of uncommitted transactions when preparing a backup, because
transactions that were uncommitted at the time of your backup may be in
progress, and it is likely that they will be committed in the next incremental
backup. You should use the :option:`--apply-log-only` option to prevent the
rollback phase.

.. note::

   If you do not use the :option:`--apply-log-only` option to prevent the
   rollback phase, then your incremental backups will be useless. After
   transactions have been rolled back, further incremental backups cannot be
   applied.

Beginning with the full backup you created, you can prepare it, and then apply
the incremental differences to it. Recall that you have the following backups:
::

  /data/backups/base
  /data/backups/inc1
  /data/backups/inc2

To prepare the base backup, you need to run :option:`--prepare` as usual, but
prevent the rollback phase: ::

  xtrabackup --prepare --apply-log-only --target-dir=/data/backups/base

The output should end with some text such as the following: ::

  101107 20:49:43  InnoDB: Shutdown completed; log sequence number 1291135

The log sequence number should match the ``to_lsn`` of the base backup, which
you saw previously.

This backup is actually safe to :ref:`restore <restoring_a_backup>` as-is now,
even though the rollback phase has been skipped. If you restore it and start
|MySQL|, |InnoDB| will detect that the rollback phase was not performed, and it
will do that in the background, as it usually does for a crash recovery upon
start. It will notify you that the database was not shut down normally.

To apply the first incremental backup to the full backup, you should use the
following command: ::

  xtrabackup --prepare --apply-log-only --target-dir=/data/backups/base \
  --incremental-dir=/data/backups/inc1

This applies the delta files to the files in :file:`/data/backups/base`, which
rolls them forward in time to the time of the incremental backup. It then
applies the redo log as usual to the result. The final data is in
:file:`/data/backups/base`, not in the incremental directory. You should see
some output such as the following: ::

  incremental backup from 1291135 is enabled.
  xtrabackup: cd to /data/backups/base/
  xtrabackup: This target seems to be already prepared.
  xtrabackup: xtrabackup_logfile detected: size=2097152, start_lsn=(1291340)
  Applying /data/backups/inc1/ibdata1.delta ...
  Applying /data/backups/inc1/test/table1.ibd.delta ...
  .... snip
  101107 20:56:30  InnoDB: Shutdown completed; log sequence number 1291340

Again, the |LSN| should match what you saw from your earlier inspection of the
first incremental backup. If you restore the files from
:file:`/data/backups/base`, you should see the state of the database as of the
first incremental backup.

Preparing the second incremental backup is a similar process: apply the deltas
to the (modified) base backup, and you will roll its data forward in time to the
point of the second incremental backup: ::

  xtrabackup --prepare --target-dir=/data/backups/base \
  --incremental-dir=/data/backups/inc2

.. note::
 
   :option:`--apply-log-only` should be used when merging all incrementals
   except the last one. That's why the previous line doesn't contain the
   :option:`--apply-log-only` option. Even if the :option:`--apply-log-only` was
   used on the last step, backup would still be consistent but in that case
   server would perform the rollback phase.

If you wish to avoid the notice that |InnoDB| was not shut down normally, when
you applied the desired deltas to the base backup, you can run
:option:`--prepare` again without disabling the rollback phase.

Restoring Incremental Backups
================================================================================

After preparing the incremental backups, the base directory contains the same
data as the full backup. To restoring this backup, you can use this command:
:bash:`xtrabackup --copy-back --target-dir=BASE-DIR`

You may have to change the ownership as detailed on
:ref:`restoring_a_backup`.

Incremental Streaming Backups Using xbstream
================================================================================

Incremental streaming backups can be performed with the |xbstream| streaming
option. Currently backups are packed in custom **xbstream** format. With this
feature, you need to take a BASE backup as well.
