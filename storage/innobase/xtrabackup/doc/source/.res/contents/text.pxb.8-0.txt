|Percona XtraBackup| 8.0 does not support making backups of databases
created in versions prior to 8.0 of |MySQL|, |Percona Server| or
|Percona XtraDB Cluster|. As the changes that |MySQL| 8.0 introduced
in *data dictionaries*, *redo log* and *undo log* are incompatible
with previous versions, it is currently impossible for |Percona
XtraBackup| 8.0 to also support versions prior to 8.0.

Due to changes in MySQL 8.0.20 released by Oracle at the end of April 2020,
|pxb| 8.0, up to version 8.0.11, is not compatible with MySQL version 8.0.20 or
higher, or Percona products that are based on it: Percona Server for MySQL and
Percona XtraDB Cluster.
