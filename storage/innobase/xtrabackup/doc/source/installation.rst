|Percona| provides repositories for :program:`yum` (``RPM`` packages for *Red Hat Enterprise Linux* and compatible distributions such as *CentOS*, *Oracle Enterprise Linux*, *Amazon Linux AMI*, and *Fedora*) and :program:`apt` (:file:`.deb` packages for *Ubuntu* and *Debian*) for software such as |Percona Server|, |XtraDB|, |Percona XtraBackup|, and |Percona Toolkit|. This makes it easy to install and update your software and its dependencies through your operating system's package manager.

This is the recommend way of installing where possible.
