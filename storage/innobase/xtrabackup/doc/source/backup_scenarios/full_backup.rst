The Backup Cycle - Full Backups
===============================

Creating a backup
=================

To create a backup, run :program:`xtrabackup` with the
:option:`xtrabackup --backup` option. You also need to specify a
:option:`xtrabackup --target-dir` option, which is where the backup will be
stored, if the |InnoDB| data or log files aren't stored in the same directory,
you might need to specify the location of those, too. If the target directory
does not exist, |xtrabackup| creates it. If the directory does exist and is
empty, |xtrabackup| will succeed. |xtrabackup| will not overwrite existing
files, it will fail with operating system error 17, ``file exists``.

To start the backup process run:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ xtrabackup --backup --target-dir=/data/backups/

This will store the backup at :file:`/data/backups/`. If you specify a
relative path, the target directory will be relative to the current directory.

During the backup process, you should see a lot of output showing the data
files being copied, as well as the log file thread repeatedly scanning the log
files and copying from it. Here is an example that shows the log thread
scanning the log in the background, and a file copying thread working on the
:file:`ibdata1` file:

.. code-block:: text

  160906 10:19:17 Finished backing up non-InnoDB tables and files

  160906 10:19:18 [00] Writing xtrabackup_info
  160906 10:19:18 [00]        ...done
  xtrabackup: Transaction log of lsn (26970807) to (137343534) was copied.
  160906 10:19:18 completed OK!

The last thing you should see is something like the following, where the value
of the ``<LSN>`` will be a number that depends on your system:

.. code-block:: text

  xtrabackup: Transaction log of lsn (<SLN>) to (<LSN>) was copied.

.. note::

  Log copying thread checks the transactional log every second to see if there
  were any new log records written that need to be copied, but there is a
  chance that the log copying thread might not be able to keep up with the
  amount of writes that go to the transactional logs, and will hit an error
  when the log records are overwritten before they could be read.

After the backup is finished, the target directory will contain files such as
the following, assuming you have a single InnoDB table :file:`test.tbl1` and
you are using MySQL's :term:`innodb_file_per_table` option:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ls -lh /data/backups/
  total 182M
  drwx------  7 root root 4.0K Sep  6 10:19 .
  drwxrwxrwt 11 root root 4.0K Sep  6 11:05 ..
  -rw-r-----  1 root root  387 Sep  6 10:19 backup-my.cnf
  -rw-r-----  1 root root  76M Sep  6 10:19 ibdata1
  drwx------  2 root root 4.0K Sep  6 10:19 mysql
  drwx------  2 root root 4.0K Sep  6 10:19 performance_schema
  drwx------  2 root root 4.0K Sep  6 10:19 sbtest
  drwx------  2 root root 4.0K Sep  6 10:19 test
  drwx------  2 root root 4.0K Sep  6 10:19 world2
  -rw-r-----  1 root root  116 Sep  6 10:19 xtrabackup_checkpoints
  -rw-r-----  1 root root  433 Sep  6 10:19 xtrabackup_info
  -rw-r-----  1 root root 106M Sep  6 10:19 xtrabackup_logfile

The backup can take a long time, depending on how large the database is. It is
safe to cancel at any time, because it does not modify the database.

The next step is getting your backup ready to be restored.

.. _preparing_a_backup:

Preparing a backup
==================

After you made a backup with the :option:`xtrabackup --backup` option, you'll
first need to prepare it in order to restore it. Data files are not
point-in-time consistent until they've been prepared, because they were copied
at different times as the program ran, and they might have been changed while
this was happening. If you try to start InnoDB with these data files, it will
detect corruption and crash itself to prevent you from running on damaged data.
The :option:`xtrabackup --prepare` step makes the files perfectly consistent at
a single instant in time, so you can run |InnoDB| on them.

You can run the prepare operation on any machine; it does not need to be on the
originating server or the server to which you intend to restore. You can copy
the backup to a utility server and prepare it there.

.. note::

  You can prepare a backup created with older |Percona XtraBackup| version with
  a newer one, but not vice versa. Preparing a backup on an unsupported server
  version should be done with the latest |Percona XtraBackup| release which
  supports that server version. For example, if one has a backup of MySQL 5.0
  created with |Percona XtraBackup| 1.6, then preparing the backup with
  |Percona XtraBackup| 2.3 is not supported, because support for MySQL 5.0 was
  removed in |Percona XtraBackup| 2.1. Instead, the latest release in the 2.0
  series should be used.

During the prepare operation, |xtrabackup| boots up a kind of modified InnoDB
that's embedded inside it (the libraries it was linked against). The
modifications are necessary to disable InnoDB's standard safety checks, such as
complaining that the log file isn't the right size, which aren't appropriate
for working with backups. These modifications are only for the xtrabackup
binary; you don't need a modified |InnoDB| to use |xtrabackup| for your
backups.

The prepare step uses this "embedded InnoDB" to perform crash recovery on the
copied data files, using the copied log file. The ``prepare`` step is very
simple to use: you simply run |xtrabackup| with the
:option:`xtrabackup --prepare` option and tell it which directory to prepare,
for example, to prepare the previously taken backup run:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ xtrabackup --prepare --target-dir=/data/backups/

When this finishes, you should see an ``InnoDB shutdown`` with a message such
as the following, where again the value of :term:`LSN` will depend on your
system:

.. code-block:: text

  InnoDB: Shutdown completed; log sequence number 137345046
  160906 11:21:01 completed OK!

All following prepares will not change the already prepared data files, you'll
see that output says:

.. code-block:: console

  xtrabackup: This target seems to be already prepared.
  xtrabackup: notice: xtrabackup_logfile was already used to '--prepare'.

It is not recommended to interrupt xtrabackup process while preparing backup
because it may cause data files corruption and backup will become unusable.
Backup validity is not guaranteed if prepare process was interrupted.

.. note::

  If you intend the backup to be the basis for further incremental backups, you
  should use the :option:`xtrabackup --apply-log-only` option when preparing
  the backup,  or you will not be able to apply incremental backups to it. See
  the documentation on preparing :ref:`incremental backups
  <incremental_backup>` for more details.

.. _restoring_a_backup:

Restoring a Backup
==================

.. warning::

  Backup needs to be :ref:`prepared <preparing_a_backup>` before it can be
  restored.

For convenience |xtrabackup| binary has an :option:`xtrabackup --copy-back`
option, which will copy the backup to the server's :term:`datadir`:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ xtrabackup --copy-back --target-dir=/data/backups/

If you don't want to save your backup, you can use the
:option:`xtrabackup --move-back` option which will move the backed up data to
the :term:`datadir`.

If you don't want to use any of the above options, you can additionally use
:program:`rsync` or :program:`cp` to restore the files.

.. note::

 The :term:`datadir` must be empty before restoring the backup. Also it's
 important to note that MySQL server needs to be shut down before restore is
 performed. You can't restore to a :term:`datadir` of a running mysqld instance
 (except when importing a partial backup).

Example of the :program:`rsync` command that can be used to restore the backup
can look like this:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ rsync -avrP /data/backup/ /var/lib/mysql/

You should check that the restored files have the correct ownership and
permissions.

As files' attributes will be preserved, in most cases you will need to change
the files' ownership to ``mysql`` before starting the database server, as they
will be owned by the user who created the backup:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ chown -R mysql:mysql /var/lib/mysql

Data is now restored and you can start the server.
