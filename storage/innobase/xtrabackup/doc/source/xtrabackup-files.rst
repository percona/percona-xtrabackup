Index of files created by Percona XtraBackup
============================================

* Information related to the backup and the server

    * :file:`backup-my.cnf`
       This file contains information to start the mini instance of InnoDB
       during the :option:`--prepare`. This is **NOT** a backup of
       original :file:`my.cnf`. The InnoDB configuration is read from the file
       :file:`backup-my.cnf` created by *Percona XtraBackup* when the backup was
       made. :option:`--prepare` uses InnoDB configuration from
       ``backup-my.cnf`` by default, or from
       :option:`--defaults-file`, if specified. InnoDB
       configuration in this context means server variables that affect data
       format, such as the ``innodb_page_size`` option,
       ``innodb_log_block_size``, etc. Location-related variables, like
       ``innodb_log_group_home_dir`` or ``innodb_data_file_path``
       are always ignored by :option:`--prepare`, so preparing
       a backup always works with data files from the backup directory, rather
       than any external ones.

    * `xtrabackup_checkpoints`
       The type of the backup (for example, full or incremental), its state (for example,
       prepared) and the LSN range contained in it. This information is used
       for incremental backups.
       Example of the `xtrabackup_checkpoints` after taking a full
       backup:

       .. code-block:: text

         backup_type = full-backuped
         from_lsn = 0
         to_lsn = 15188961605
         last_lsn = 15188961605

       Example of the :file:`xtrabackup_checkpoints` after taking an incremental
       backup:

       .. code-block:: text

         backup_type = incremental
         from_lsn = 15188961605
         to_lsn = 15189350111
         last_lsn = 15189350111

    * :file:`xtrabackup_binlog_info`
       The binary log file used by the server and its position at the moment of the backup. A result of the following query: 
         .. sourcecode:: mysql 

               SELECT server_uuid, local, replication, storage_engines FROM performance_schema.log_status;

    * :file:`xtrabackup_binary`
       The *Percona XtraBackup* binary used in the process.

    * :file:`xtrabackup_logfile`
       Contains data needed for running the: :option:`--prepare`.
       The bigger this file is the :option:`--prepare` process
       will take longer to finish.

    * :file:`<table_name>.delta.meta`
       This file is going to be created when performing the incremental backup.
       It contains the per-table delta metadata: page size, size of compressed
       page (if the value is 0 it means the tablespace isn't compressed) and
       space id. Example of this file could looks like this:

       .. code-block:: text

        page_size = 16384
        zip_size = 0
        space_id = 0

* Information related to the replication environment (if using the
  :option:`--slave-info` option):

    * :file:`xtrabackup_slave_info`
       The ``CHANGE MASTER`` statement needed for setting up a replica.

* Information related to the *Galera* and *Percona XtraDB Cluster* (if using
  the :option:`--galera-info` option):

    * :file:`xtrabackup_galera_info`
       Contains the values of ``wsrep_local_state_uuid`` and
       ``wsrep_last_committed`` status variables
