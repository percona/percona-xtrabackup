==================================
 Connection and Privileges Needed
==================================

|Percona XtraBackup| needs to be able to connect to the database server and
perform operations on the server and the :term:`datadir` when creating a
backup, when preparing in some scenarios and when restoring it. In order to do
so, there are privileges and permission requirements on its execution that
must be fulfilled.

Privileges refers to the operations that a system user is permitted to do in
the database server. **They are set at the database server and only apply to
users in the database server**.

Permissions are those which permits a user to perform operations on the system,
like reading, writing or executing on a certain directory or start/stop a
system service. **They are set at a system level and only apply to system
users**.

Whether |xtrabackup| or |innobackupex| is used, there are two actors involved:
the user invoking the program - *a system user* - and the user performing
action in the database server - *a database user*. Note that these are
different users in different places, even though they may have the same
username.

All the invocations of |innobackupex| and |xtrabackup| in this documentation
assume that the system user has the appropriate permissions and you are
providing the relevant options for connecting the database server - besides the
options for the action to be performed - and the database user has adequate
privileges.

Connecting to the server
========================

The database user used to connect to the server and its password are specified
by the :option:`--user` and :option:`--password` option:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ xtrabackup --user=DVADER --password=14MY0URF4TH3R --backup \
    --target-dir=/data/bkps/
  $ innobackupex --user=DBUSER --password=SECRET /path/to/backup/dir/
  $ innobackupex --user=LUKE  --password=US3TH3F0RC3 --stream=tar ./ | bzip2 -

If you don't use the :option:`--user` option, |Percona XtraBackup| will assume
the database user whose name is the system user executing it.

Other Connection Options
------------------------

According to your system, you may need to specify one or more of the following
options to connect to the server:

===========  ==================================================================
Option       Description
===========  ==================================================================
--port       The port to use when connecting to the database server with
             TCP/IP.
--socket     The socket to use when connecting to the local database.
--host       The host to use when connecting to the database server with
             TCP/IP.
===========  ==================================================================

These options are passed to the :command:`mysql` child process without
alteration, see :option:`mysql --help` for details.

.. note::

   In case of multiple server instances the correct connection parameters
   (port, socket, host) must be specified in order for |xtrabackup| to talk to
   the correct server.


Permissions and Privileges Needed
=================================

Once connected to the server, in order to perform a backup you will need
``READ``, ``WRITE`` and ``EXECUTE`` permissions at a filesystem level in the
server's :term:`datadir`.

The database user needs the following privileges on the tables/databases to be
backed up:

  * ``RELOAD`` and ``LOCK TABLES`` (unless the
    :option:`--no-lock <innobackupex --no-lock>` option is specified) in order
    to ``FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK`` and ``FLUSH ENGINE LOGS`` prior to start
    copying the files, and  ``LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP`` and ``LOCK BINLOG FOR
    BACKUP`` require this privilege when `Backup Locks
    <http://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/5.6/management/backup_locks.html>`_
    are used,

  * ``REPLICATION CLIENT`` in order to obtain the binary log position,

  * ``CREATE TABLESPACE`` in order to import tables (see :ref:`imp_exp_ibk`),

  * ``PROCESS`` in order to run ``SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS`` (which is
    mandatory), and optionally to see all threads which are running on the
    server (see :ref:`improved_ftwrl`),

  * ``SUPER`` in order to start/stop the slave threads in a replication
    environment, use `XtraDB Changed Page Tracking
    <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/5.6/management/changed_page_tracking.html>`_
    for :ref:`xb_incremental` and for :ref:`improved_ftwrl`,

  * ``CREATE`` privilege in order to create the
    :ref:`PERCONA_SCHEMA.xtrabackup_history <xtrabackup_history>` database and
    table,

  * ``INSERT`` privilege in order to add history records to the
    :ref:`PERCONA_SCHEMA.xtrabackup_history <xtrabackup_history>` table,

  * ``SELECT`` privilege in order to use
    :option:`innobackupex --incremental-history-name` or
    :option:`innobackupex --incremental-history-uuid` in order for the feature
    to look up the ``innodb_to_lsn`` values in the
    :ref:`PERCONA_SCHEMA.xtrabackup_history <xtrabackup_history>` table.

The explanation of when these are used can be found in
:ref:`how_xtrabackup_works`.

An SQL example of creating a database user with the minimum privileges required
to full backups would be:

.. code-block:: mysql

  mysql> CREATE USER 'bkpuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 's3cret';
  mysql> GRANT RELOAD, LOCK TABLES, PROCESS, REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO
         'bkpuser'@'localhost';
  mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
