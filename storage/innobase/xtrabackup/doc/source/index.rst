====================================
 Percona XtraBackup - Documentation
====================================

|Percona XtraBackup| is an open-source hot backup utility for
|MySQL| - based servers that doesn't lock your database during the
backup.

Whether it is a 24x7 highly loaded server or a low-transaction-volume
environment, |Percona XtraBackup| is designed to make backups a seamless
procedure without disrupting the performance of the server in a production
environment. `Commercial support contracts are available
<http://www.percona.com/mysql-support/>`_.

|Percona XtraBackup| can back up data from |InnoDB|, |XtraDB|, 
|MyISAM|, and MyRocks tables on |MySQL| 8.0 servers as well as |Percona Server|
with |XtraDB|, |Percona Server| 8.0, and |Percona XtraDB Cluster| 8.0.
