 Percona XtraBackup - Documentation
====================================

*Percona XtraBackup* is an open-source hot backup utility for
*MySQL* - based servers that doesn't lock your database during the
backup.

Whether it is a 24x7 highly loaded server or a low-transaction-volume
environment, *Percona XtraBackup* is designed to make backups a seamless
procedure without disrupting the performance of the server in a production
environment. `Commercial support contracts are available
<http://www.percona.com/mysql-support/>`_.

*Percona XtraBackup* can back up data from *InnoDB*, *XtraDB*, 
*MyISAM*, and MyRocks tables on *MySQL* 8.0 servers as well as *Percona Server for MySQL*
with *XtraDB*, *Percona Server for MySQL* 8.0, and *Percona XtraDB Cluster* 8.0.
