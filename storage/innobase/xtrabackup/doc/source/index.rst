 Percona XtraBackup - Documentation
====================================

*Percona XtraBackup* is an open-source hot backup utility for
*MySQL* - based servers that doesn't lock your database during the
backup.

Whether it is a 24x7 highly loaded server or a low-transaction-volume
environment, *Percona XtraBackup* is designed to make backups a seamless
procedure without disrupting the performance of the server in a production
environment. `Commercial support contracts are available
<http://www.percona.com/mysql-support/>`_.

*Percona XtraBackup* can back up data from |InnoDB|, |XtraDB|, 
|MyISAM|, and MyRocks tables on *MySQL* 8.0 servers as well as *Percona Server for MySQL*
with *XtraDB*, *Percona Server for MySQL* 8.0, and *Percona XtraDB Cluster* 8.0. 

*Percona XtraBackup* does not support backup or restore of the `MyRocks ZenFS <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/LATEST/myrocks/zenfs.html>`__ data at this time

*Percona XtraBackup* 8.0 only supports making backups of the databases
created by the 8.0 versions of the *MySQL*, *Percona Server for MySQL* or
*Percona XtraDB Cluster*. The format changes that *MySQL* 8.0 introduced
in the *data dictionaries*, the *redo log*, and the *undo log* are incompatible
with previous versions of *Percona XtraBackup*.

Due to changes in *MySQL* 8.0.20, released by Oracle at the end of April 2020,
*Percona XtraBackup* 8.0, up to version 8.0.11, is not compatible with *MySQL* version 8.0.20 or higher, or the Percona products that are based on it: *Percona Server for MySQL* and *Percona XtraDB Cluster*.

For more information, see `Percona XtraBackup 8.x and MySQL 8.0.20
<https://www.percona.com/blog/2020/04/28/percona-xtrabackup-8-x-and-mysql-8-0-20/>`_
