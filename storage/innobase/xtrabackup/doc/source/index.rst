====================================
 Percona XtraBackup - Documentation
====================================

|Percona XtraBackup| is an open-source hot backup utility for |MySQL| - based
servers that doesn't lock your database during the backup.

It can back up data from |InnoDB|, |XtraDB|, and |MyISAM| tables on |MySQL| 5.1
[#n-1]_, 5.5, 5.6 and 5.7 servers, as well as |Percona Server| with |XtraDB|.
For a high-level overview of many of its advanced features, including a feature
comparison, please see :doc:`intro`.

Whether it is a 24x7 highly loaded server or a low-transaction-volume
environment, |Percona XtraBackup| is designed to make backups a seamless
procedure without disrupting the performance of the server in a production
environment. `Commercial support contracts are available
<http://www.percona.com/mysql-support/>`_.
