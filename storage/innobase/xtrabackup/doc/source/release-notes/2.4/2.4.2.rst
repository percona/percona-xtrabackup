Bugs Fixed
----------

 When backup was taken on *MariaDB* 10 with GTID enabled, |Percona XtraBackup|
 didn't store ``gtid_slave_pos`` in :file:`xtrabackup_slave_info` but logged it
 only to ``STDERR``. Bug fixed :bug:`1404484`.

 Backup process would fail if :option:`xtrabackup --throttle` option was used.
 Bug fixed :bug:`1554235`.
