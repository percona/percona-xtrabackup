==========================

Percona is glad to announce the release of |Percona XtraBackup| 2.4.6
on February 17th 2017. Downloads are available from our `download site
<http://www.percona.com/downloads/XtraBackup/>`_ and from :ref:`apt
<apt_repo>` and :ref:`yum <yum_repo>` repositories.

This release is the GA (Generally Available) stable release in the 2.4
series.

New features
------------

 |Percona XtraBackup| has implemented new
 :option:`xtrabackup --remove-original` option that can be used to remove the
 encrypted and compressed files once they've been decrypted/decompressed.

Bugs Fixed
----------

 |xtrabackup| was using username set for server in a configuration file even if
 a different user was defined in the users configuration file. Bug fixed
 :bug:`1551706`.

 Incremental backups did not include :file:`xtrabackup_binlog_info` and
 :file:`xtrabackup_galera_info` files. Bug fixed :bug:`1643803`.

 In case a warning was written to stout instead of stderr during the streaming
 backup, it could cause assertion in the |xbstream|. Bug fixed :bug:`1647340`.

 :option:`xtrabackup --move-back` did not always restore out-of-datadir
 tablespaces to their original directories. Bug fixed :bug:`1648322`.

 |innobackupex| and |xtrabackup| scripts were showing the password in the
 :program:`ps` output when it was passed as a command line argument. Bug fixed
 :bug:`907280`

 Incremental backup would fail with path like ``~/backup/inc_1``
 because |xtrabackup| didn't properly expand tilde. Bug fixed :bug:`1642826`.

 Fixed missing dependency check for ``Perl Digest::MD5`` in rpm packages. This
 will now require ``perl-MD5`` package to be installed from *EPEL* repositories
 on *CentOS 5* and *CentOS 6* (along with ``libev``). Bug fixed :bug:`1644018`.

 |Percona XtraBackup| now supports ``-h``, ``-u`` and ``-p`` shortcuts for
 ``--hostname``, ``--user`` and ``--password``. Bugs fixed :bug:`1655438` and
 :bug:`1652044`.

Other bugs fixed: :bug:`1655278`.
