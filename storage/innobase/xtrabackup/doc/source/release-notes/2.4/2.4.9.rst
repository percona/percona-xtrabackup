New Features
============

 *Percona XtraBackup* packages are now available for *Ubuntu 17.10 (Artful)*.

 xbcrypt now has an ability to decrypt files in parallel by specifying the
 number of threads with the `xtrabackup --encrypt-threads` option.

 `xtrabackup --copy-back` option can now be used with
 `xtrabackup --parallel` option to copy the user data files in
 parallel (redo logs and system tablespaces are copied in the main thread).

Bugs fixed
==========

 *Percona XtraBackup* would fail to backup large databases on 32-bit platforms.
 Bug fixed :jirabug:`PXB-481`.

 *Percona XtraBackup* failed to build with *GCC 7*. Bug fixed :jirabug:`PXB-502`.

 *Percona XtraBackup* would hang during the prepare phase if there was not
 enough room in log buffer to accommodate checkpoint information at the end
 of the crash recovery process. Bug fixed :jirabug:`PXB-506`.

 When backup was streamed in tar format with with the
 `xtrabackup --slave-info` option
 output file `xtrabackup_slave_info` did not contain the slave
 information. Bug fixed :jirabug:`PXB-507`.

 If `xtrabackup --slave-info` was used while backing up 5.7 instances,
 the master binary log coordinates were not properly displayed in the logs.
 Bug fixed :jirabug:`PXB-508`.

 `innobackupex --slave-info` would report a single ``m`` instead of
 ``slave info`` in the standard output. Bug fixed :jirabug:`PXB-510`.

 *Percona XtraBackup* would crash while preparing the 5.5 backup with
 ``utf8_general50_ci`` collation. Bug fixed :jirabug:`PXB-748` (*Fungo Wang*).

 *Percona XtraBackup* would crash if `xtrabackup --throttle` was used
 while preparing backups. Fixed by making this option available only during the
 backup process. Bug fixed :jirabug:`PXB-789`.

 *Percona XtraBackup* could get stuck if backups are taken with
 `xtrabackup --safe-slave-backup` option, while there were long
 running queries. Bug fixed :jirabug:`PXB-1039`.

Other bugs fixed: :jirabug:`PXB-250`, :jirabug:`PXB-511`, and :jirabug:`PXB-512`.
