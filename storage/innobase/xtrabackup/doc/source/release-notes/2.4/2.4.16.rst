|Percona XtraBackup| |release|
================================================================================

Percona is glad to announce the release of |Percona XtraBackup| |release| on
|date|. Downloads are available from our `download site
<http://www.percona.com/downloads/Percona-XtraBackup-2.4/>`_ and
from :ref:`apt <apt_repo>` and :ref:`yum <yum_repo>` repositories. 

All Percona software is open-source and free.

Improvements
================================================================================

- Two options (--backup-lock-timeout and --backup-lock-retry-count) were added
  to enable the configuring of the timeout for acquiring metadata locks in
  ``FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK``, ``LOCK TABLE FOR BACKUP``, and ``LOCK BINLOG
  FOR BACKUP`` statements. More information in :jirabug:`PXB-1914`

Bugs Fixed
================================================================================

- |Percona Xtrabackup| was not able to connect to the database when
  the password was specified along with the transition-key
  parameter. Bug fixed :jirabug:`PXB-1902`.
- In some cases, |Percona Xtrabackup| stuck with redo log corruption
  when master key is rotated. Bug fixed :jirabug:`PXB-1903`.
- In rare cases, when both full and incremental backups were made
  before MySQL flushed the first page of the encrypted tablespace,
  |Percona Xtrabackup| could crash during the incremental backup
  prepare for the tablespace encryption. Bug fixed
  :jirabug:`PXB-1894`.
- An encrypted table could not be restored when ADD/DROP INDEX was run
  on the table. Bug fixed :jirabug:`PXB-1905`.
- In some cases :option:`xtrabackup --prepare` could fail to decrypt a
  table but reported that the operation *completed ok*. Bug fixed
  :jirabug:`PXB-1936`.
