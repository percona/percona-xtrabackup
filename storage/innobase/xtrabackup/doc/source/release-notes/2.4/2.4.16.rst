*Percona XtraBackup* 2.4.16
================================================================================

Percona is glad to announce the release of *Percona XtraBackup* 2.4.16 on
November 4, 2019. Downloads are available from our `download site
<http://www.percona.com/downloads/Percona-XtraBackup-2.4/>`_ and
from :ref:`apt <apt_repo>` and :ref:`yum <yum_repo>` repositories. 

All Percona software is open-source and free.

Improvements
================================================================================

- Two options (--backup-lock-timeout and --backup-lock-retry-count) were added
  to enable the configuring of the timeout for acquiring metadata locks in
  ``FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK``, ``LOCK TABLE FOR BACKUP``, and ``LOCK BINLOG
  FOR BACKUP`` statements. More information in :jirabug:`PXB-1914`

Bugs Fixed
================================================================================

- Percona Xtrabackup was not able to connect to the database when
  the password was specified along with the transition-key
  parameter. Bug fixed :jirabug:`PXB-1902`.
- In some cases, Percona Xtrabackup stuck with redo log corruption
  when master key is rotated. Bug fixed :jirabug:`PXB-1903`.
- In rare cases, when both full and incremental backups were made
  before MySQL flushed the first page of the encrypted tablespace,
  Percona Xtrabackup could crash during the incremental backup
  prepare for the tablespace encryption. Bug fixed
  :jirabug:`PXB-1894`.
- An encrypted table could not be restored when ADD/DROP INDEX was run
  on the table. Bug fixed :jirabug:`PXB-1905`.
- In some cases `xtrabackup --prepare` could fail to decrypt a
  table but reported that the operation *completed ok*. Bug fixed
  :jirabug:`PXB-1936`.
