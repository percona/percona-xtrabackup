*Percona XtraBackup* 2.4.7
==========================

Percona is glad to announce the release of *Percona XtraBackup* 2.4.7 on
April 17th 2017. Downloads are available from our `download site
<http://www.percona.com/downloads/XtraBackup/Percona-XtraBackup-2.4.7/>`_ and
from :ref:`apt <apt_repo>` and :ref:`yum <yum_repo>` repositories.

This release is the current GA (Generally Available) stable release in the 2.4
series.

New Features
============

 *Percona XtraBackup* now uses hardware accelerated implementation of ``crc32``
 where it is supported.

 *Percona XtraBackup* has implemented new options:
 `xtrabackup --tables-exclude` and
 `xtrabackup --databases-exclude`
 that work similar to `xtrabackup --tables` and
 `xtrabackup --databases`
 options, but exclude given names/paths from backup.

 :ref:`xbstream_binary` now supports parallel extraction with the
 ``--parallel`` option.

 :ref:`xbstream_binary` now supports following new options: ``--decrypt``,
 ``--encrypt-threads``, ``--encrypt-key``, and ``--encrypt-key-file``.
 When ``--decrypt`` option is specified xbstream will automatically decrypt
 encrypted files when extracting input stream. Either ``--encrypt-key`` or
 ``--encrypt-key-file`` options must be specified to provide encryption key,
 but not both. Option ``--encrypt-threads`` specifies the number of worker
 threads doing the encryption, default is ``1``.

Bugs fixed
==========

 Backups were missing `*.isl` files for general tablespace. Bug fixed
 :jirabug:`PXB-494`.

 In 5.7 *MySQL* changed default checksum algorithm to ``crc32``, while
 *xtrabackup* was using ``innodb``. This caused *xtrabackup* to perform extra
 checksum calculations which were not needed. Bug fixed :jirabug:`PXB-495`.

 For system tablespaces consisting of multiple files *xtrabackup* updated LSN
 only in first file. This caused *MySQL* versions lower than 5.7 to fail on
 startup. Bug fixed :jirabug:`PXB-498`.

 `xtrabackup --export` can now export tables that have more than 31
 index. Bug fixed :jirabug:`PXB-58`.

 ``Unrecognized character \x01; marked by <-- HERE`` message could be seen if
 backups were taken with the version check enabled. Bug fixed
 :jirabug:`PXB-944`.
