New features
------------

 |Percona XtraBackup| has removed the multiple binaries (``xtrabackup_56``, ``xtrabackup_55``, ``xtrabackup``) and now uses single ``xtrabackup`` binary instead for handling backups. Single binary implementation removed the requirement to download server source tarballs and removed different patches which resulted in cleaner code.
 
 |Percona XtraBackup| source layout has been changed to implement the single binary. |Percona XtraBackup| code can now be found in :file:`storage/innobase/xtrabackup`.

 |Percona XtraBackup| implemented support for `Backup Locks <http://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/5.6/management/backup_locks.html#backup-locks>`_.

 |Percona XtraBackup| can now store :ref:`backup history <storing_history>` on the server itself in a special table created for that purpose. 

 ``innobackupex-1.5.1`` symlink has been removed, instead |innobackupex| binary should be used.

 |Percona XtraBackup| has removed the ``build.sh`` script and it's now :ref:`built with CMake <compiling_xtrabackup>`. 

 |Percona XtraBackup| has been rebased on |MySQL| 5.6.16.

Bugs Fixed
----------

 Information about tool version used to take the backup was added by implementing :ref:`backup history <storing_history>` feature. Bug fixed :bug:`1133017`.
 
 If an XtraDB-based binary was used to a backup an |InnoDB| database, it will convert it to |XtraDB| by adding the ``XTRADB_1`` marker in the dictionary header page and by adding the ``SYS_STATS`` table. Bug fixed :bug:`988310`.
 
Other bugs fixed: :bug:`721690`, :bug:`1255899`, :bug:`1255901`, :bug:`1268300`, and :bug:`788316`.
