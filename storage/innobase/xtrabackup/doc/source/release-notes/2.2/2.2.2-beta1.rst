 |Percona XtraBackup| 2.2.2-beta1
=======================================

Percona is glad to announce the release of |Percona XtraBackup| 2.2.2-beta1 on May 8th 2014. Downloads are available from our download site `here <http://www.percona.com/downloads/XtraBackup/2.2.2/>`_. This **BETA** release will be available in :ref:`Debian experimental <debian_testing>` and :ref:`CentOS testing <yum_testing>` repositories. 

This is a **BETA** quality release and it is not intended for production. If you want a high quality, Generally Available release, the current Stable version should be used (currently 2.1.9 in the 2.1 series at the time of writing).

New Features
------------

 |Percona XtraBackup| has now been rebased on |MySQL| 5.6.17.

 |Percona XtraBackup| package is now available for *Ubuntu* 14.04.

Bugs Fixed
----------

 |Percona XtraBackup| couldn't be built with *Bison* 3.0. Bug fixed :bug:`1262439`.

 The xtrabackup binaries now recognize a new :file:`my.cnf` option, :option:`open_files_limit`. The effect is the same as for the server: it changes the maximum number of file descriptors available to the xtrabackup process. The actual limit depends on the platform and ``ulimit`` settings. Bug fixed :bug:`1183793`.
 
 If a remote |InnoDB| tablespace got CREATEd or ALTERed during the backup, an attempt to prepare such a backup later would lead to |Percona XtraBackup| crash. Bug fixed :bug:`1291299`.

 Code in both |innobackupex| and |xtrabackup|, that was supposed to make sure no child processes are left running in case |innobackupex| got killed or failed with an error, relied on the fact the ``SIGTERM`` and ``SIGINT`` signals were not blocked by the xtrabackup process. However, both ``SIGTERM`` and ``SIGINT`` might be blocked by the process that had invoked |innobackupex|, for example, by the |Percona XtraDB Cluster| server processes doing an SST, in which case they were also blocked by the xtrabackup process, since the signal mask is inherited by child processes. Fixed by replacing ``SIGTERM`` in |innobackupex| and ``SIGINT`` in |xtrabackup| auto-termination with ``SIGKILL``. Bug fixed :bug:`1294782`.


All of Percona's software is open-source and free, all the details of the release can be found in the `2.2.2-beta1 milestone <https://launchpad.net/percona-xtrabackup/+milestone/2.2.2-beta1>`_ at Launchpad.
