Percona XtraBackup enables MySQL backups without blocking user queries, making it ideal
for companies with large data sets and mission-critical applications that cannot tolerate
long periods of downtime. Offered free as an open source solution, it drives down backup
costs while providing unique features for MySQL backups.

Percona XtraBackup 8.0.12 now supports backup and restore processing for all versions of MySQL; previous versions of Percona XtraBackup will not work with MySQL 8.0.20 and higher.
