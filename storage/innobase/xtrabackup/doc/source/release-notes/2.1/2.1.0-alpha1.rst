|Percona XtraBackup| 2.1.0-alpha1
================================================================================

Percona is glad to announce the release of |Percona XtraBackup| 2.1.0-alpha1 on
April 2nd 2013. Downloads are available from our download site `here
<http://www.percona.com/downloads/XtraBackup/2.1.0/>`_. For this ALPHA release,
we will not be making APT and YUM repositories available, just base deb and RPM
packages

This is an *ALPHA* quality release and is not intended for production. If you
want a high quality, Generally Available release, the current Stable version
should be used (currently 2.0.6 in the 2.0 series at the time of writing).

This release contains all of the features and bug fixes in :doc:`Percona
XtraBackup 2.0.6 </release-notes/2.0/2.0.6>`, plus the following:

New features
================================================================================

|Percona XtraBackup| now has support for :ref:`compact_backups_ibk`. This
feature can be used for taking the backups that will take less amount of disk
space.

|Percona XtraBackup| has implemented :ref:`encrypted_backups_ibk`. This feature
can be used to encrypt/decrypt both local and streamed backups in order to add
another layer of protection to the backups.

|innobackupex| now uses Perl's ``DBD::MySQL`` package for server communication
instead of spawning the mysql command line client.

Support for |InnoDB| 5.0 and |InnoDB| 5.1 builtin has been removed from |Percona
XtraBackup|.

After being deprecated in previous version, option ``--remote-host`` has
been completely removed in |Percona XtraBackup| 2.1.

Bugs Fixed
================================================================================

|innobackupex| now supports empty arguments in :option:`innobackupex
--password`. Bug fixed :bug:`1032667` (*Andrew Gaul*).
