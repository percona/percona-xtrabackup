New Features
------------

 |Percona XtraBackup| 2.3 command line syntax has been changed to follow `command-line-option guidelines <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/command-line-options.html>`_. 

Bugs fixed
----------

 :ref:`xbcloud <xbcloud_binary>` contained password in the processlist which would allow an unprivileged user privileged access to the swift service, and more likely the entire openstack deploy for which keystone is providing the identity service. Bug fixed :bug:`1447610`.

 |Percona XtraBackup| 2.3 didn't set :option:`wait_timeout` session variable in order to prevent server to kill the connection while it is copying data files. Bug fixed :bug:`1495367`.

 :ref:`xbcloud <xbcloud_binary>` would fail to create a container with ``error: curl_easy_perform() failed: Failed sending data to the peer``. Bug fixed :bug:`1500508`.

 In some cases streaming backup could be corrupted due to a broken pipe error, particularly if error occurred when |xtrabackup| copied set of tiny files (:file:`*.frm` or similar), but |xtrabackup| would not notice it and complete successfully. Bug fixed :bug:`1452387`. 

 |xtrabackup| 2.3 now adds timestamps to the ``STDERR`` output. Bug fixed :bug:`1454692`.

 Stream decryption would fail if the encryption options were in :file:`my.cnf` configuration file because they were ignored by |innobackupex|. Bug fixed :bug:`1190335`.
 
 Fixed broken out-of-source tree builds in 2.3 trunk. Bug fixed :bug:`1457016`.

 |Percona XtraBackup| now supports :option:`--datadir` as a command line option. Bug fixed :bug:`1042887`.
