series.

Bugs fixed
================================================================================

|Percona XtraBackup| didn't respect variables stored in :file:`backup-my.cnf`
unless it was specified. One needed to specify ``--defaults-file=backup-my.cnf``
for options to be respected. Bug fixed :bug:`1527081`.

|Percona XtraBackup| didn't abort the backup if :option:`innobackupex --rsync`
completed with error. Bug fixed :bug:`1537256`.

When backup was taken on *MariaDB* 10 with GTID enabled, |Percona XtraBackup|
didn't store ``gtid_slave_pos`` in :file:`xtrabackup_slave_info` but logged it
only to ``STDERR``. Bug fixed :bug:`1404484`.

|Percona XtraBackup| was silently skipping extra arguments. Bug fixed
:bug:`1533542` (*Fungo Wang*).

|Percona XtraBackup| refuses client connecting to server if it uses old
(pre-4.1.1) protocol. To disable this check in order to allow backing up servers
with legacy passwords still set, new ``xtrabackup --skip-secure-auth``
option has been implemented. Bug fixed :bug:`1508450`.
