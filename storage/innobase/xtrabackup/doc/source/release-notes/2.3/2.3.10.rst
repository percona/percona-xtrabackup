This release is the current GA (Generally Available) stable release in the 2.3
series.

New Features
============

 |Percona XtraBackup| packages are now available for *Ubuntu 17.10 (Artful)*.

 |xbcrypt| now has an ability to decrypt files in parallel by specifying the
 number of threads with the :option:`xtrabackup --encrypt-threads` option.

 :option:`xtrabackup --copy-back` option can now be used with
 :option:`xtrabackup --parallel` option to copy the user data files in
 parallel (redo logs and system tablespaces are copied in the main thread).

Bugs fixed
==========

 |Percona XtraBackup| failed to build with *GCC 7*. Bug fixed :bug:`1681721`.

 |Percona XtraBackup| would crash while preparing the 5.5 backup with
 ``utf8_general50_ci`` collation. Bug fixed :bug:`1533722` (*Fungo Wang*).

 |Percona XtraBackup| would crash if :option:`xtrabackup --throttle` was used
 while preparing backups. Fixed by making this option available only during the
 backup process. Bug fixed :bug:`1691093`.

 |Percona XtraBackup| could get stuck if backups are taken with
 :option:`xtrabackup --safe-slave-backup` option, while there were long
 running queries. Bug fixed :bug:`1717158`.
