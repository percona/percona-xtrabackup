 The :program:`innobackupex` Option Reference
=============================================

.. program:: innobackupex

This page documents all of the command-line options for the :program:`innobackupex` Perl script.


Options
=======

.. option:: --apply-log

   Prepare a backup in ``BACKUP-DIR`` by applying the transaction log file named :file:`xtrabackup_logfile` located in the same directory. Also, create new transaction logs. The InnoDB configuration is read from the file :file:`backup-my.cnf` created by |innobackupex| when the backup was made. innobackupex --apply-log uses InnoDB configuration from ``backup-my.cnf`` by default, or from --defaults-file, if specified. InnoDB configuration in this context means server variables that affect data format, i.e. :option:`innodb_page_size`, :option:`innodb_log_block_size`, etc. Location-related variables, like :option:`innodb_log_group_home_dir` or :option:`innodb_data_file_path` are always ignored by --apply-log, so preparing a backup always works with data files from the backup directory, rather than any external ones.

.. option:: --backup-locks

   This option controls if backup locks should be used instead of FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK on the backup stage. The option has no effect when backup locks are not supported by the server. This option is enabled by default, disable with ``--no-backup-locks``.


.. option:: --close-files

   Do not keep files opened. This option is passed directly to xtrabackup. When xtrabackup opens tablespace it normally doesn't close its file handle in order to handle the DDL operations correctly. However, if the number of tablespaces is really huge and can not fit into any limit, there is an option to close file handles once they are no longer accessed. |Percona XtraBackup| can produce inconsistent backups with this option enabled. Use at your own risk.

.. option:: --compact

   Create a compact backup with all secondary index pages omitted. This option is passed directly to xtrabackup.  See the :program:`xtrabackup` :doc:`documentation <../xtrabackup_bin/xtrabackup_binary>` for details.

.. option:: --compress

   This option instructs xtrabackup to compress backup copies of InnoDB data files. It is passed directly to the xtrabackup child process. See the :program:`xtrabackup` :doc:`documentation <../xtrabackup_bin/xtrabackup_binary>` for details.

.. option::  --compress-threads=#

   This option specifies the number of worker threads that will be used for parallel compression. It is passed directly to the xtrabackup child process. See the :program:`xtrabackup` :doc:`documentation <../xtrabackup_bin/xtrabackup_binary>` for details.

.. option:: --compress-chunk-size=#

   This option specifies the size of the internal working buffer for each compression thread, measured in bytes. It is passed directly to the xtrabackup child process. The default value is 64K. See the :program:`xtrabackup` :doc:`documentation <../xtrabackup_bin/xtrabackup_binary>` for details.

.. option:: --copy-back

    Copy all the files in a previously made backup from the backup directory to their original locations.

.. option:: --databases=LIST

   This option specifies the list of databases that |innobackupex| should back up. The option accepts a string argument or path to file that contains the list of databases to back up. The list is of the form "databasename1[.table_name1] databasename2[.table_name2] . . .". If this option is not specified, all databases containing |MyISAM| and |InnoDB| tables will be backed up. Please make sure that --databases contains all of the |InnoDB| databases and tables, so that all of the innodb.frm files are also backed up. In case the list is very long, this can be specified in a file, and the full path of the file can be specified instead of the list. (See option --tables-file.)

.. option:: --decompress

   Decompresses all files with the .qp extension in a backup previously made with the --compress option. The :option:`innobackupex --parallel` option will allow multiple files to be decrypted and/or decompressed simultaneously. In order to decompress, the qpress utility MUST be installed and accessable within the path. This process will remove the original compressed/encrypted files and leave the results in the same location.

.. option:: --decrypt=ENCRYPTION-ALGORITHM

   Decrypts all files with the .xbcrypt extension in a backup previously made with --encrypt option. The :option:`innobackupex --parallel` option will allow multiple files to be decrypted and/or decompressed simultaneously. 

.. option:: --defaults-file=[MY.CNF]

   This option accepts a string argument that specifies what file to read the default MySQL options from. It is also passed directly to :program:`xtrabackup` 's defaults-file option. See the :program:`xtrabackup` :doc:`documentation <../xtrabackup_bin/xtrabackup_binary>` for details.

.. option:: --defaults-extra-file=[MY.CNF]

   This option specifies what extra file to read the default |MySQL| options from before the standard defaults-file. The option accepts a string argument. It is also passed directly to xtrabackup's --defaults-extra-file option. See the :program:`xtrabackup` :doc:`documentation <../xtrabackup_bin/xtrabackup_binary>` for details.

.. option:: --defaults-group=GROUP-NAME

   This option accepts a string argument that specifies the group which should be read from the configuration file. This is needed if you use mysqld_multi. This can also be used to indicate groups other than mysqld and xtrabackup.

.. option:: --encrypt=ENCRYPTION_ALGORITHM

   This option instructs xtrabackup to encrypt backup copies of InnoDB data files using the algorithm specified in the ENCRYPTION_ALGORITHM. It is passed directly to the xtrabackup child process. See the :program:`xtrabackup` :doc:`documentation <../xtrabackup_bin/xtrabackup_binary>` for more details.

.. option:: --encrypt-key=ENCRYPTION_KEY

   This option instructs xtrabackup to use the given ENCRYPTION_KEY when using the --encrypt option. It is passed directly to the xtrabackup child process. See the :program:`xtrabackup` :doc:`documentation <../xtrabackup_bin/xtrabackup_binary>` for more details.

.. option:: --encrypt-key-file=ENCRYPTION_KEY_FILE

   This option instructs xtrabackup to use the encryption key stored in the given ENCRYPTION_KEY_FILE when using the --encrypt option. It is passed directly to the xtrabackup child process. See the :program:`xtrabackup` :doc:`documentation <../xtrabackup_bin/xtrabackup_binary>` for more details.

.. option:: --encrypt-threads=#

   This option specifies the number of worker threads that will be used for parallel encryption. It is passed directly to the xtrabackup child process. See the :program:`xtrabackup` :doc:`documentation <../xtrabackup_bin/xtrabackup_binary>` for more details.

.. option:: --encrypt-chunk-size=#

   This option specifies the size of the internal working buffer for each encryption thread, measured in bytes. It is passed directly to the xtrabackup child process. See the :program:`xtrabackup` :doc:`documentation <../xtrabackup_bin/xtrabackup_binary>` for more details.

.. option:: --export

   This option is passed directly to :option:`xtrabackup --export` option. It enables exporting individual tables for import into another server. See the |xtrabackup| documentation for details.

.. option:: --extra-lsndir=DIRECTORY

   This option accepts a string argument that specifies the directory in which to save an extra copy of the :file:`xtrabackup_checkpoints` file. It is passed directly to |xtrabackup|'s :option:`--extra-lsndir` option. See the :program:`xtrabackup` documentation for details.

.. option:: --force-non-empty-directories 

   When specified, it makes :option:`innobackupex --copy-back` option or :option:`innobackupex --move-back` option transfer files to non-empty directories. No existing files will be overwritten. If --copy-back or --move-back has to copy a file from the backup directory which already exists in the destination directory, it will still fail with an error.

.. option:: --galera-info

   This options creates the ``xtrabackup_galera_info`` file which contains the local node state at the time of the backup. Option should be used when performing the backup of Percona-XtraDB-Cluster. Has no effect when backup locks are used to create the backup.

.. option:: --help

   This option displays a help screen and exits.

.. option:: --history=NAME

   This option enables the tracking of backup history in the ``PERCONA_SCHEMA.xtrabackup_history`` table. An optional history series name may be specified that will be placed with the history record for the current backup being taken.

.. option:: --host=HOST

   This option accepts a string argument that specifies the host to use when connecting to the database server with TCP/IP. It is passed to the mysql child process without alteration. See :command:`mysql --help` for details.

.. option:: --ibbackup=IBBACKUP-BINARY

   This option specifies which |xtrabackup| binary should be used. The option accepts a string argument. IBBACKUP-BINARY should be the command used to run |Percona XtraBackup|. The option can be useful if the |xtrabackup| binary is not in your search path or working directory. If this option is not specified, |innobackupex| attempts to determine the binary to use automatically.

.. option:: --include=REGEXP

   This option is a regular expression to be matched against table names in ``databasename.tablename`` format. It is passed directly to xtrabackup's :option:`xtrabackup --tables` option. See the :program:`xtrabackup` documentation for details.

.. option:: --incremental

   This option tells |xtrabackup| to create an incremental backup, rather than a full one. It is passed to the |xtrabackup| child process. When this option is specified, either :option:`--incremental-lsn` or :option:`--incremental-basedir` can also be given. If neither option is given, option :option:`--incremental-basedir` is passed to :program:`xtrabackup` by default, set to the first timestamped backup directory in the backup base directory.

.. option:: --incremental-basedir=DIRECTORY

   This option accepts a string argument that specifies the directory containing the full backup that is the base dataset for the incremental backup. It is used with the :option:`--incremental` option.

.. option:: --incremental-dir=DIRECTORY

   This option accepts a string argument that specifies the directory where the incremental backup will be combined with the full backup to make a new full backup. It is used with the :option:`--incremental` option.

.. option:: --incremental-history-name=NAME

   This option specifies the name of the backup series stored in the :ref:`PERCONA_SCHEMA.xtrabackup_history <xtrabackup_history>` history record to base an incremental backup on. Percona Xtrabackup will search the history table looking for the most recent (highest innodb_to_lsn), successful backup in the series and take the to_lsn value to use as the starting lsn for the incremental backup. This will be mutually exclusive with :option:`innobackupex --incremental-history-uuid`,:option:`innobackupex --incremental-basedir` and :option:`innobackupex --incremental-lsn`. If no valid lsn can be found (no series by that name, no successful backups by that name) xtrabackup will return with an error. It is used with the :option:`innobackupex --incremental` option.

.. option:: --incremental-history-uuid=UUID

   This option specifies the UUID of the specific history record stored in the :ref:`PERCONA_SCHEMA.xtrabackup_history <xtrabackup_history>` to base an incremental backup on. :option:`innobackupex --incremental-history-name`,:optionL`innobackupex --incremental-basedir` and :option:`innobackupex --incremental-lsn`. If no valid lsn can be found (no success record with that uuid) xtrabackup will return with an error. It is used with the :option:`innobackupex --incremental` option.

.. option:: --incremental-lsn=LSN

   This option accepts a string argument that specifies the log sequence number (:term:`LSN`) to use for the incremental backup. It is used with the :option:`--incremental` option. It is used instead of specifying :option:`--incremental-basedir`. For databases created by *MySQL* and *Percona Server* 5.0-series versions, specify the as two 32-bit integers in high:low format. For databases created in 5.1 and later, specify the LSN as a single 64-bit integer.

.. option:: --kill-long-queries-timeout=SECONDS

   This option specifies the number of seconds innobackupex waits between starting ``FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK`` and killing those queries that block it. Default is 0 seconds, which means innobackupex will not attempt to kill any queries. In order to use this option xtrabackup user should have ``PROCESS`` and ``SUPER`` privileges.

.. option:: --kill-long-query-type=all|select

   This option specifies which types of queries should be killed to unblock the global lock. Default is "all".

.. option:: --lock-wait-timeout=SECONDS

   This option specifies time in seconds that innobackupex should wait for queries that would block ``FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK`` before running it. If there are still such queries when the timeout expires, innobackupex terminates with an error. Default is 0, in which case innobackupex does not wait for queries to complete and starts ``FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK`` immediately.

.. option:: --lock-wait-threshold=SECONDS

   This option specifies the query run time threshold which is used by innobackupex to detect long-running queries with a non-zero value of :option:`innobackupex --lock-wait-timeout`. FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK`` is not started until such long-running queries exist. This option has no effect if --lock-wait-timeout is 0. Default value is 60 seconds.

.. option:: --lock-wait-query-type=all|update

   This option specifies which types of queries are allowed to complete before innobackupex will issue the global lock. Default is all.

.. option:: --log-copy-interval=#

   This option specifies time interval between checks done by log copying thread in milliseconds.

.. option:: --move-back

    Move all the files in a previously made backup from the backup directory to their original locations. As this option removes backup files, it must be used with caution.

.. option:: --no-lock

   Use this option to disable table lock with ``FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK``. Use it only if ALL your tables are InnoDB and you **DO NOT CARE** about the binary log position of the backup. This option shouldn't be used if there are any ``DDL`` statements being executed or if any updates are happening on non-InnoDB tables (this includes the system MyISAM tables in the *mysql* database), otherwise it could lead to an inconsistent backup. 
   If you are considering to use :option:`--no-lock` because your backups are failing to acquire the lock, this could be because of incoming replication events preventing the lock from succeeding. Please try using :option:`--safe-slave-backup` to momentarily stop the replication slave thread, this may help the backup to succeed and you then don't need to resort to using this option.
   :file:`xtrabackup_binlog_info` is not created when --no-lock option is used (because ``SHOW MASTER STATUS`` may be inconsistent), but under certain conditions :file:`xtrabackup_binlog_pos_innodb` can be used instead to get consistent binlog coordinates as described in :ref:`working_with_binlogs`.
.. option:: --no-timestamp

   This option prevents creation of a time-stamped subdirectory of the ``BACKUP-ROOT-DIR`` given on the command line. When it is specified, the backup is done in ``BACKUP-ROOT-DIR`` instead.

.. option:: --no-version-check

   This option disables the version check which is enabled by the --version-check option.

.. option:: --parallel=NUMBER-OF-THREADS

   This option accepts an integer argument that specifies the number of threads the :program:`xtrabackup` child process should use to back up files concurrently.  Note that this option works on file level, that is, if you have several .ibd files, they will be copied in parallel. If your tables are stored together in a single tablespace file, it will have no effect. This option will allow multiple files to be decrypted and/or decompressed simultaneously. In order to decompress, the qpress utility MUST be installed and accessable within the path. This process will remove the original compressed/encrypted files and leave the results in the same location. It is passed directly to xtrabackup's :option:`xtrabackup --parallel` option. See the :program:`xtrabackup` documentation for details

.. option:: --password=PASSWORD

   This option accepts a string argument specifying the password to use when connecting to the database. It is passed to the :command:`mysql` child process without alteration. See :command:`mysql --help` for details.

.. option:: --port=PORT

   This option accepts a string argument that specifies the port to use when connecting to the database server with TCP/IP. It is passed to the :command:`mysql` child process. It is passed to the :command:`mysql` child process without alteration. See :command:`mysql --help` for details.

.. option:: --rebuild-indexes

   This option only has effect when used together with the --apply-log option and is passed directly to xtrabackup. When used, makes xtrabackup rebuild all secondary indexes after applying the log. This option is normally used to prepare compact backups. See the :program:`xtrabackup` documentation for more information.

.. option:: --rebuild-threads=NUMBER-OF-THREADS

   This option only has effect when used together with the --apply-log and --rebuild-indexes option and is passed directly to xtrabackup. When used, xtrabackup processes tablespaces in parallel with the specified number of threads when rebuilding indexes. See the :program:`xtrabackup` documentation for more information.

.. option:: --redo-only

   This option should be used when preparing the base full backup and when merging all incrementals except the last one. It is passed directly to xtrabackup's :option:`xtrabackup --apply-log-only` option. This forces :program:`xtrabackup` to skip the "rollback" phase and do a "redo" only. This is necessary if the backup will have incremental changes applied to it later. See the |xtrabackup| :doc:`documentation <../xtrabackup_bin/incremental_backups>` for details.

.. option:: --rsync

   Uses the :program:`rsync` utility to optimize local file transfers. When this option is specified, :program:`innobackupex` uses :program:`rsync` to copy all non-InnoDB files instead of spawning a separate :program:`cp` for each file, which can be much faster for servers with a large number of databases or tables.  This option cannot be used together with :option:`--stream`.

.. option:: --safe-slave-backup

   Stop slave SQL thread and wait to start backup until ``Slave_open_temp_tables`` in ``SHOW STATUS`` is zero. If there are no open temporary tables, the backup will take place, otherwise the SQL thread will be started and stopped until there are no open temporary tables. The backup will fail if ``Slave_open_temp_tables`` does not become zero after :option:`--safe-slave-backup-timeout` seconds. The slave SQL thread will be restarted when the backup finishes.

.. option:: --safe-slave-backup-timeout=SECONDS

   How many seconds :option:`--safe-slave-backup`` should wait for ``Slave_open_temp_tables`` to become zero. Defaults to 300 seconds.

.. option:: --scpopt = SCP-OPTIONS

   This option accepts a string argument that specifies the command line options to pass to :command:`scp` when the option :option:`--remost-host` is specified. If the option is not specified, the default options are ``-Cp -c arcfour``.

.. option:: --slave-info

   This option is useful when backing up a replication slave server. It prints the binary log position and name of the master server. It also writes this information to the :file:`xtrabackup_slave_info` file as a ``CHANGE MASTER`` command. A new slave for this master can be set up by starting a slave server on this backup and issuing a ``CHANGE MASTER`` command with the binary log position saved in the :file:`xtrabackup_slave_info` file.

.. option:: --socket

   This option accepts a string argument that specifies the socket to use when connecting to the local database server with a UNIX domain socket. It is passed to the mysql child process without alteration. See :command:`mysql --help` for details.

.. option:: --sshopt=SSH-OPTIONS

   This option accepts a string argument that specifies the command line options to pass to :command:`ssh` when the option :option:`--remost-host` is specified.

.. option:: --stream=STREAMNAME

   This option accepts a string argument that specifies the format in which to do the streamed backup. The backup will be done to ``STDOUT`` in the specified format. Currently, supported formats are `tar` and `xbstream`. Uses :doc:`xbstream <../xbstream/xbstream>`, which is available in |Percona XtraBackup| distributions. If you specify a path after this option, it will be interpreted as the value of :option:`tmpdir`

.. option:: --tables-file=FILE

   This option accepts a string argument that specifies the file in which there are a list of names of the form ``database.table``, one per line. The option is passed directly to :program:`xtrabackup` 's :option:`--tables-file` option.

.. option:: --throttle=IOS

   This option accepts an integer argument that specifies the number of I/O operations (i.e., pairs of read+write) per second. It is passed directly to xtrabackup's :option:`xtrabackup --throttle` option. **NOTE:** This option works only during the backup phase, ie. it will not work with :option:`innobackupex --apply-log` and :option:`innobackupex --copy-back` options.

.. option:: --tmpdir=DIRECTORY

   This option accepts a string argument that specifies the location where a temporary file will be stored. It may be used when :option:`--stream` is specified. For these options, the transaction log will first be stored to a temporary file, before streaming or copying to a remote host. This option specifies the location where that temporary file will be stored. If the option is not specified, the default is to use the value of ``tmpdir`` read from the server configuration. innobackupex is passing the tmpdir value specified in my.cnf as the --target-dir option to the xtrabackup binary. Both [mysqld] and [xtrabackup] groups are read from my.cnf. If there is tmpdir in both, then the value being used depends on the order of those group in my.cnf.

.. option:: --use-memory=#

   This option accepts a string argument that specifies the amount of memory in bytes for :program:`xtrabackup` to use for crash recovery while preparing a backup. Multiples are supported providing the unit (e.g. 1MB, 1M, 1GB, 1G). It is used only with the option :option:`--apply-log`. It is passed directly to xtrabackup's :option:`xtrabackup --use-memory` option. See the |xtrabackup| documentation for details.

.. option:: --user=USER

   This option accepts a string argument that specifies the user (i.e., the *MySQL* username used when connecting to the server) to login as, if that's not the current user. It is passed to the mysql child process without alteration. See :command:`mysql --help` for details.

.. option:: --version

   This option displays the |innobackupex| version and copyright notice and then exits.

.. option:: --version-check

   When this option is specified, innobackupex will perform a version check against the server on the backup stage after creating a server connection.
