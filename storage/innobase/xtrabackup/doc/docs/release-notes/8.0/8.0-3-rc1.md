# Percona XtraBackup 8.0-3-rc1

Percona is glad to announce the release of Percona XtraBackup 8.0-3-rc1 on
October 31 2018. Downloads are available from our [download site](http://www.percona.com/downloads/XtraBackup/) and from apt
and yum repositories.

This is a **Release Candidate** quality release and it is not intended for
production. If you want a high quality, Generally Available release, use the
current Stable version (the most recent stable version at the time of writing is
2.4.12 in the 2.4 series).

### Things to Note


* `innobackupex` was previously deprecated and has been removed


* Due to the new MySQL redo log and data dictionary formats the
Percona XtraBackup 8.0.x versions will only be compatible with MySQL
8.0.x and the upcoming Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.x


* For experimental migrations from earlier database server versions,
you will need to [backup and restore and using XtraBackup 2.4](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-xtrabackup/2.4/how-tos.html#recipes-for-xtrabackup)
and then use `mysql_upgrade` from MySQL 8.0.x

## Improvements


* [PXB-1655](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-1655): The `--lock-ddl` option is supported when backing up MySQL 8

## Bugs Fixed


* [PXB-1678](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-1678): Incremental backup prepare with the `--apply-log-only`
option could roll back uncommitted transactions


* [PXB-1672](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-1672): The MTS slave without GTID could be backed up when the
`--safe-slave-backup` option was applied.
