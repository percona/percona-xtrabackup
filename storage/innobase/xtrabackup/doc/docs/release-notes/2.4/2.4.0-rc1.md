## New features

*Percona XtraBackup* has implemented basic support for *MySQL* 5.7 and *Percona Server for MySQL* 5.7.

## Known Issues

* Backed-up table data could not be recovered if backup was taken while running
`OPTIMIZE TABLE` (bug [PXB-1360](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-1360)) or `ALTER TABLE ... TABLESPACE` (bug
[PXB-1360](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-1360)) on that table.

* Compact Backups currently donâ€™t work due to bug [PXB-372](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-372).
