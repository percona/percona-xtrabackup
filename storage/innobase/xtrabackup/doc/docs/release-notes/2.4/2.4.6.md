# *Percona XtraBackup* 2.4.6

Percona is glad to announce the release of *Percona XtraBackup* 2.4.6
on February 22nd 2017. Downloads are available from our [download site](http://www.percona.com/downloads/XtraBackup/) and from [apt](../../installation/apt_repo.md#apt-repo) and [yum](../../installation/yum_repo.md#yum-repo) repositories.

This release is the GA (Generally Available) stable release in the 2.4
series.

## New features

*Percona XtraBackup* has implemented new
`xtrabackup --remove-original` option that can be used to remove the
encrypted and compressed files once they’ve been decrypted/decompressed.

## Bugs Fixed

* *xtrabackup* was using username set for server in a configuration file even if
a different user was defined in the users configuration file. Bug fixed
[PXB-463](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-463).

* Incremental backups did not include `xtrabackup_binlog_info` and
xtrabackup_galera_info files. Bug fixed [PXB-489](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-489).

* In case a warning was written to stout instead of stderr during the streaming
backup, it could cause assertion in the xbstream. Bug fixed [PXB-491](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-491).

* `xtrabackup --move-back` did not always restore out-of-datadir
tablespaces to their original directories. Bug fixed [PXB-492](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-492).

* innobackupex and *xtrabackup* scripts were showing the password in the
`ps` output when it was passed as a command line argument. Bug fixed
[PXB-585](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-585)

* Incremental backup would fail with path like `~/backup/inc_1`
because *xtrabackup* didn’t properly expand tilde. Bug fixed [PXB-775](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-775).

* Fixed missing dependency check for `perl(Digest::MD5)` in rpm packages. Bug
fixed [PXB-777](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-777).

* *Percona XtraBackup* now supports `-H`, `-h`, `-u` and `-p` shortcuts
for `--hostname`, `--datadir`, `--user` and `--password` respectively.
Bugs fixed [PXB-947](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-947) and [PXB-1032](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-1032).

* **[UPDATE 2016-02-28]:** New packages have been pushed to repositories with
incremented package version to address the bug [PXB-497](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-497).

Other bugs fixed: [PXB-945](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-945).
