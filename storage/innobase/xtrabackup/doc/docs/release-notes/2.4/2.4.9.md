enough room in log buffer to accommodate checkpoint information at the end
of the crash recovery process. Bug fixed [PXB-506](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-506).

* When backup was streamed in tar format with with the
`xtrabackup --slave-info` option
output file `xtrabackup_slave_info` did not contain the slave
information. Bug fixed [PXB-507](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-507).

* If xtrabackup â€“slave-info was used while backing up 5.7 instances,
the master binary log coordinates were not properly displayed in the logs.
