# *Percona XtraBackup* 2.4.2

Percona is glad to announce the release of *Percona XtraBackup* 2.4.2 on April
1st 2016. Downloads are available from our [download site](http://www.percona.com/downloads/XtraBackup/) and from [apt](../../installation/apt_repo.md#apt-repo)
and [yum](../../installation/yum_repo.md#yum-repo) repositories.

This release is the GA (Generally Available) stable release in the 2.4 series.

## New features

* *Percona XtraBackup* has [implemented support](../../advanced/encrypted_innodb_tablespace_backups.md#encrypted-innodb-tablespace-backups) for [InnoDB tablespace encryption](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-tablespace-encryption.html).

* *Percona XtraBackup* has been rebased on *MySQL* 5.7.11.

## Bugs Fixed

* When backup was taken on *MariaDB* 10 with GTID enabled, *Percona XtraBackup*
didnâ€™t store `gtid_slave_pos` in `xtrabackup_slave_info` but logged it
only to `STDERR`. Bug fixed [PXB-715](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-715).

* Backup process would fail if `xtrabackup --throttle` option was used.
Bug fixed [PXB-465](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-465).
