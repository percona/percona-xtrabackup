    April 26, 2022


[Percona XtraBackup for MySQL Databases](https://www.percona.com/software/mysql-database/percona-xtrabackup) enables MySQL backups without blocking user queries. Percona XtraBackup is ideal for companies with large data sets and mission-critical applications that cannot tolerate long periods of downtime. Offered free as an open source solution, Percona XtraBackup drives down backup costs while providing unique features for MySQL backups.

Percona XtraBackup 2.4 does not support making backups of databases created in *MySQL 8.0*, *Percona Server for MySQL 8.0*, or *Percona XtraDB Cluster 8.0*. Use [Percona XtraBackup 8.0](https://www.percona.com/downloads/Percona-XtraBackup-LATEST/#) to make backups for these versions.

## Release Highlights
