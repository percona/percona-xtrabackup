# Accelerating the backup process

## Accelerating with `innobackupex --parallel` copy and `--compress-threads`

When performing a local backup or the streaming backup with *xbstream* option, multiple files can be copied concurrently by using the `innobackupex --parallel` option. This option specifies the number of threads created by *xtrabackup* to copy data files.

To take advantage of this option either the multiple tablespaces option must be enabled (`innodb_file_per_table`) or the shared tablespace must be stored in multiple `ibdata` files with the `innodb_data_file_path` option. Having multiple files for the database (or splitting one into many) doesnâ€™t have a measurable impact on performance.

As this feature is implemented **at a file level**, concurrent file transfer can sometimes increase I/O throughput when doing a backup on highly fragmented data files, due to the overlap of a greater number of random read requests. You should consider tuning the filesystem also to obtain the maximum performance (e.g. checking fragmentation).

If the data is stored on a single file, this option will have no effect.

To use this feature, simply add the option to a local backup, for example:

```default
$ innobackupex --parallel=4 /path/to/backup
```

By using the *xbstream* in streaming backups you can additionally speed up the compression process by using the `innobackupex --compress-threads` option. This option specifies the number of threads created by *xtrabackup* for  for parallel data compression. The default value for this option is 1.

To use this feature, simply add the option to a local backup, for example

```default
$ innobackupex --stream=xbstream --compress --compress-threads=4 ./ > backup.xbstream
```

Before applying logs, compressed files will need to be uncompressed.

## Accelerating with `innobackupex --rsync`

In order to speed up the backup process and to minimize the time `FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK` is blocking the writes, option `innobackupex --rsync` should be used. When this option is specified, *innobackupex* uses `rsync` to copy all non-InnoDB files instead of spawning a separate `cp` for each file, which can be much faster for servers with a large number of databases or tables. *innobackupex* will call the `rsync` twice, once before the `FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK` and once during to minimize the time the read lock is being held. During the second `rsync` call, it will only synchronize the changes to non-transactional data (if any) since the first call performed before the `FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK`. Note that *Percona XtraBackup* will use [Backup locks](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/5.6/management/backup_locks.html#backup-locks) where available as a lightweight alternative to `FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK`. This feature is available in *Percona Server for MySQL* 5.6+. *Percona XtraBackup* uses this automatically to copy non-InnoDB data to avoid blocking DML queries that modify InnoDB tables.

!!! note

    This option cannot be used together with the `innobackupex --stream` option.
