This sample directory contains programs with examples of insert, delete, and find.

To run the programs, use the node command with one of the program names, e.g.

node insert author "this is a great little program"

The programs require a database table to exist. To create the table,
run the create.sql script with the standard mysql command, e.g. 

mysql < create.sql
