   If current member is leaving the group it needs to clean all the saved
   recovery metadata. This is done by setting a clear flag in
   "Recovery_metadata_processing_packets". If current member is not leaving the
   group then it needs to remove other saved leaving members, which is done by:
   1. Pass the list of members that are leaving the group via
   "Recovery_metadata_processing_packets"
   2. Recovery_metadata_processing_packets packets is added to the
   applier-pipeline.
   3. Since add of the Recovery metadata is handled by the applier-pipeline and
   delete of Recovery metadata is also being done from the applier pipeline we
   need not synchronize the add and delete operations. Applier-pipeline is
   single threaded.
   4. Pipeline will call the function
   delete_members_from_all_recovery_view_metadata_send_metadata_if_sender_left
   of Recovery_metadata_module to do the proper cleanup.
   5. During cleanup
   delete_members_from_all_recovery_view_metadata_send_metadata_if_sender_left
   will remove leaving members from the valid sender list.
   6. During cleanup
   delete_members_from_all_recovery_view_metadata_send_metadata_if_sender_left
   will remove leaving members from the joiner list.
   7. If post cleanup there are no joiner or the valid sender for the view,
   delete_members_from_all_recovery_view_metadata_send_metadata_if_sender_left
   mark such views for deletion.
   8.
   delete_members_from_all_recovery_view_metadata_send_metadata_if_sender_left
   deletes all the stored metadata of the views marked for deletion.
   9. If the metadata sender had left the group,
   delete_members_from_all_recovery_view_metadata_send_metadata_if_sender_left
   finds the new metadata sender and re-sends the recovery metadata. In short
   entire process is being done from Recovery_metadata_processing_packets
   pipeline packet.
