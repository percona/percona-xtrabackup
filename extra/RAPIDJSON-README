The rapidjson library included in this directory is based on
https://github.com/miloyip/rapidjson, upstream commit
3a4835e080d213c60842f58f207991fbb1c97f74.

There are three changes made to the library:

1) Two lines have been added to reader.h, which fix an assertion in the library
   when a JSON document contains illegally escaped unicode characters. See
   upstream commit b7e34100ed167b8134b41fcff0918895dd4e61fb for the changes.

2) Rapidjson-specific changes in commit 91153f3385c4917a215aa4c7818b3f6265608286
   have been applied, so that negative zero is handled properly (bug#19504183).

3) The fix for a bug in the parsing of floating point numbers has been
   applied to reader.h (bug#21384048). See details in the upstream bug
   report at https://github.com/miloyip/rapidjson/issues/313 and the
   following upstream commits:
