How to build XtraBackup on Linux
================================

Prerequisites
-------------

The following packages and tools must be installed to compile 
Percona XtraBackup from source. These might vary from system to system.

In Debian-based distributions, you need to:

  $ apt-get install build-essential flex bison automake autoconf bzr \
    libtool cmake libaio-dev mysql-client libncurses-dev zlib1g-dev \
    libgcrypt11-dev

In RPM-based distributions, you need to:

  $ yum install cmake gcc gcc-c++ libaio libaio-devel automake autoconf bzr \
    bison libtool ncurses5-devel
    
Compiling under SLES 12.1
--------------------

In order to compile xtrabackup for SLES 12.1 you'll need the following packages:

  $ zypper install autoconf automake bison bzr cmake gcc gcc-c++ libaio libaio-devel libcurl-devel libev-devel libev4 libgcrypt-devel libncurses5 libtool ncurses-devel python-Sphinx
  
after that you need to disable compiling with Man pages (unless you need them) by changing the cmake option `WITH_MAN_PAGES` to `OFF` in `cmake/build_configurations/xtrabackup_release.cmake`

Then you can continue with the instructions below

Compiling with CMake
--------------------

At the base directory of the source code tree, if you execute

  $ cmake -DBUILD_CONFIG=xtrabackup_release && make -j4

and you go for a coffee, at your return XtraBackup will be ready to be used.

Installation
------------

The following command:

$ make install

will install all XtraBackup binaries, the innobackupex script and tests
to /usr/local/xtrabackup. You can override this either with “make
DESTDIR=... install” or by changing the installation layout with “cmake
-DINSTALL_LAYOUT=...”.
